					<description><![CDATA[Today's links Google reneged on the monopolistic bargain: A search monopolist should never do a layoff, buyback or dividend for so long as it's enshittifying. The Bezzle excerpt (Part IV): LA Sheriff's Deputies are the most violent gangs in LA. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Google reneged on the monopolistic bargain (permalink) A funny thing happened on the way to the enshittocene: Google &#8211; which astonished the world when it reinvented search, blowing Altavista and Yahoo out of the water with a search tool that seemed magic &#8211; suddenly turned into a pile of shit. Google's search results are terrible. The top of the page is dominated by spam, scams, and ads. A surprising number of those ads are scams. Sometimes, these are high-stakes scams played out by well-resourced adversaries who stand to make a fortune by tricking Google: https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/phone-numbers-airlines-listed-google-directed-scammers-rcna94766 But often these scams are perpetrated by petty grifters who are making a couple bucks at this. These aren't hyper-resourced, sophisticated attackers. They're the SEO equivalent of script kiddies, and they're running circles around Google: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/24/passive-income/#swiss-cheese-security Google search is empirically worsening. The SEO industry spends every hour that god sends trying to figure out how to sleaze their way to the top of the search results, and even if Google defeats 99% of these attempts, the 1% that squeak through end up dominating the results page for any consequential query: https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf Google insists that this isn't true, and if it is true, it's not their fault because the bad guys out there are so numerous, dedicated and inventive that Google can't help but be overwhelmed by them: https://searchengineland.com/is-google-search-getting-worse-389658 It wasn't supposed to be this way. Google has long maintained that its scale is the only thing that keeps us safe from the scammers and spammers who would otherwise overwhelm any lesser-resourced defender. That's why it was so imperative that they pursue such aggressive growth, buying up hundreds of companies and integrating their products with search so that every mobile device, every ad, every video, every website, had one of Google's tendrils in it. This is the argument that Google's defenders have put forward in their messaging on the long-overdue antitrust case against Google, where we learned that Google is spending $26b/year to make sure you never try another search engine: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/google-paid-26-3-billion-to-be-default-search-engine-in-2021 Google, we were told, had achieved such intense scale that the normal laws of commercial and technological physics no longer applied. Take security: it's an iron law that "there is no security in obscurity." A system that is only secure when its adversaries don't understand how it works is not a secure system. As Bruce Schneier says, "anyone can design a security system that they themselves can't break. That doesn't mean it works &#8211; just that it works for people stupider than them." And yet, Google operates one of the world's most consequential security system &#8211; The Algorithm (TM) &#8211; in total secrecy. We're not allowed to know how Google's ranking system works, what its criteria are, or even when it changes: "If we told you that, the spammers would win." Well, they kept it a secret, and the spammers won anyway. A viral post by Housefresh &#8211; who review air purifiers &#8211; describes how Google's algorithmic failures, which send the worst sites to the top of the heap, have made it impossible for high-quality review sites to compete: https://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/ You've doubtless encountered these bad review sites. Search for "Best ______ 2024" and the results are a series of near-identical lists, strewn with Amazon affiliate links. Google has endlessly tinkered with its guidelines and algorithmic weights for review sites, and none of it has made a difference. For example, when Google instituted a policy that reviewers should "discuss the benefits and drawbacks of something, based on your own original research," sites that had previously regurgitated the same lists of the same top ten Amazon bestsellers "peppered their pages with references to a ‘rigorous testing process,’ their ‘lab team,’ subject matter experts ‘they collaborated with,’ and complicated methodologies that seem impressive at a cursory look." But these grandiose claims &#8211; like the 67 air purifiers supposedly tested in Better Homes and Gardens's Des Moines lab &#8211; result in zero in-depth reviews and no published data. Moreover, these claims to rigorous testing materialized within a few days of Google changing its search ranking and said that high rankings would be reserved for sites that did testing. Most damning of all is how the Better Homes and Gardens top air purifiers perform in comparison to the &#8211; extensively documented &#8211; tests performed by Housefresh: "plagued by high-priced and underperforming units, Amazon bestsellers with dubious origins (that also underperform), and even subpar devices from companies that market their products with phrases like ‘the Tesla of air purifiers.’" One of the top ranked items on BH&#38;G comes from Molekule, a company that filed for bankruptcy after being sued for false advertising. The model BH&#38;G chose was ranked "the worst air purifier tested" by Wirecutter and "not living up to the hype" by Consumer Reports. Either BH&#38;G's rigorous testing process is a fiction that they infused their site with in response to a Google policy change, or BH&#38;G absolutely sucks at rigorous testing. BH&#38;G's competitors commit the same sins &#8211; literally, the exact same sins. Real Simple's reviews list the same photographer and the photos seem to have been taken in the same place. They also list the same person as their "expert." Real Simple has the same corporate parent as BH&#38;G: Dotdash Meredith. As Housefresh shows, there's a lot of Dotdash Meredith review photos that seem to have been taken in the same place, by the same person. But the competitors of these magazines are no better. Buzzfeed lists 22 air purifiers, including that crapgadget from Molekule. Their "methodology" is to include screenshots of Amazon reviews. A lot of the top ranked sites for air purifiers are once-great magazines that have been bought and enshittified by private equity giants, like Popular Science, which began as a magazine in 1872 and became a shambling zombie in 2023, after its PE owners North Equity LLC decided its googlejuice was worth more than its integrity and turned it into a metastatic chumbox of shitty affiliate-link SEO-bait. As Housefresh points out, the marketing team that runs PopSci makes a lot of hay out of the 150 years of trust that went into the magazine, but the actual reviews are thin anaecdotes, unbacked by even the pretense of empiricism (oh, and they loooove Molekule). Some of the biggest, most powerful, most trusted publications in the world have a side-hustle in quietly producing SEO-friendly "10 Best ___________ of 2024" lists: Rolling Stone, Forbes, US News and Report, CNN, New York Magazine, CNN, CNET, Tom's Guide, and more. Google literally has one job: to detect this kind of thing and crush it. The deal we made with Google was, "You monopolize search and use your monopoly rents to ensure that we never, ever try another search engine. In return, you will somehow distinguish between low-effort, useless nonsense and good information. You promised us that if you got to be the unelected, permanent overlord of all information access, you would 'organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.'" They broke the deal. Companies like CNET used to do real, rigorous product reviews. As Housefresh points out, CNET once bought an entire smart home and used it to test products. Then Red Ventures bought CNET and bet that they could sell the house, switch to vibes-based reviewing, and that Google wouldn't even notice. They were right. https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/welcome-to-the-cnet-smart-home/ Google downranks sites that spend money and time on reviews like Housefresh and GearLab, and crams botshittened content mills like BH&#38;G into our eyeballs instead. In 1558, Thomas Gresham coined (ahem) Gresham's Law: "Bad money drives out good." When counterfeit money circulates in the economy, anyone who gets a dodgy coin spends it as quickly as they can, because the longer you hold it, the greater the likelihood that someone will detect the fraud and the coin will become worthless. Run this system long enough and all the money in circulation is funny money. An internet run by Google has its own Gresham's Law: bad sites drive out good. It's not just that BH&#38;G can "test" products at a fraction of the cost of Housefresh &#8211; through the simple expedient of doing inadequate tests or no tests at all &#8211; so they can put a lot more content up that Housefresh. But that alone wouldn't let them drive Housefresh off the front page of Google's search results. For that, BH&#38;G has to mobilize some of their savings from the no test/bad test lab to do real rigorous science: science in defeating Google's security-through-obscurity system, which lets them command the front page despite publishing worse-than-useless nonsense. Google has lost the spam wars. In response to the plague of botshit clogging Google search results, the company has invested in&#8230;making more botshit: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/16/tweedledumber/#easily-spooked Last year, Google did a $70b stock buyback. They also laid off 12,000 staffers (whose salaries could have been funded for 27 years by that stock buyback). They just laid off thousands more employees. That wasn't the deal. The deal was that Google would get a monopoly, and they would spend their monopoly rents to be so good that you could just click "I'm feeling lucky" and be teleported to the very best response to your query. A company that can't figure out the difference between a scam like Better Homes and Gardens and a rigorous review site like Housefresh should be pouring every spare dime it brings in into fixing this problem. Not buying default search status on every platform so that we never try another search engine: they should be fixing their shit. When Google admits that it's losing the war to these kack-handed spam-farmers, that's frustrating. When they light $26b/year on fire making sure you don't ever get to try anything else, that's very frustrating. When they vaporize seventy billion dollars on financial engineering and shoot one in ten engineers, that's outrageous. Google's scale has transcended the laws of business physics: they can sell an ever-degrading product and command an ever-greater share of our economy, even as their incompetence dooms any decent, honest venture to obscurity while providing fertile ground &#8211; and endless temptation &#8211; for scammers. The Bezzle excerpt (Part IV) (permalink) This week marks the publication of my latest novel, The Bezzle, and to celebrate, I'm serializing an excerpt from Chapter 14 in six parts: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle The Bezzle is a revenge story, a crime novel, and a technothriller. It stars Martin Hench, a hard-fighting forensic accountant who specializes in unwinding high-tech scams. Hench made his debt in last year's Red Team Blues (now in paperback!); The Bezzle is a standalone followup: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865854/redteamblues The serial tells the tale of Stefon Magner, AKA Steve Soul, a once-famous R&#38;B frontman whose disintegrating career turned to tragedy when his crooked manager forged his signature on a rights assignment contract that let him steal all of Stefon's royalties, which ballooned after modern hiphop artists discovered his grooves and started buying licenses to sample them. The first three installments related the sad circumstances of Stefon's life, and the real-world analogues (like Leonard Cohen and George Clinton, both of whom were pauperized by sticky-fingered managers) as well as one real-world countermeasure, copyright termination, a thing that more artists should know about and use: https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/26/take-it-back/ Today's installment weaves in a major subplot for the first time in the serial: Los Angeles's notorious, murderous Sheriff's Deputy gangs. These are another unbelievable true tale: for decades, the LASD's deputies have formed themselves into criminal gangs, some of which require that initiates murder someone to be inducted: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LASD_deputy_gangs They sport gang tattoos, have secret signs, and run vast criminal enterprises. This has been the subject of numerous investigative press reports, and one extensive official report that called the gangs "a cancer": https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/deputy-gangs-cancer-los-angeles-county-sheriffs-department-scathing-re-rcna73367 The sordid tales of the LASD gangs beggar belief. For example, deputies in charge of LA County jails forced inmates to pit-fight and took bets on the outcomes: https://www.aclu.org/publications/report-cruel-and-usual-punishment-how-savage-gang-deputies-controls-la-county-jails The taxpayers of LA have shelled out tens of millions of dollars to settle claims against LA's criminals with badges: https://news.yahoo.com/deputies-accused-being-secret-societies-230851807.html Periodically, LA judges and officials will insist that they are tackling the problem: https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-17/dozens-of-lasd-deputies-ordered-to-show-suspected-gang-tattoos-reveal-others-who-have-them But at every turn, the LA police "unions" manage to crush these investigations: https://abc7.com/los-angeles-county-lasd-deputy-gangs-cliques/13492081/ And top cops are right there with them, insisting that these aren't "gangs" &#8211; they're just "subgroups": https://lapublicpress.org/2024/01/former-la-sheriff-villanueva-sheriffs-gangs-are-just-subgroups/ It's very weird being an Angeleno and knowing that one of the largest, most militarized, best funded police departments in the world has been openly captured by a hyperviolent crime syndicate. When I was in the Skyboat Media studios last December with Wil Wheaton recording the audiobook for The Bezzle, Wil broke off from reading to say, "You know, someone's going to read this and google it and have their mind blown when they discover that it's real": https://sowl.co/8nyGh That's one of my favorite ways to turn literature into something more than entertainment. It's why I filled the Little Brother books with real-world surveillance, cryptography and security tech, giving enough detail to advance the plot and give readers an idea of what search terms would let them understand and use the concepts in the novel. That's something I'm happy to keep up with the Hench novels, unpicking the inner workings of scams and corruption. The more of us who are wise to this, the sooner we'll be able to get rid of it. Here's part one of the serial: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/17/the-steve-soul-caper/#lead-singer-disease Part two: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/19/crad-kilodney-was-an-outlier/#copyright-termination Part three: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/20/fore/#lawyer-up And now, onto part four! * * * The last of the boxes had been shelved. Benedetto rose from his chair. “Thank you, gentlemen,” he said to the movers, and dug a roll of twenties out of his pocket and handed each of them two of their own. He turned to me as they filed out. “You wanna get sushi? The place next door is great.” The empty storefront was in a down-­at-­heels strip mall in Eagle Rock. On one side, there was a Brazilian jujitsu studio that never seemed to have any students training in it. On the other side was Sushi Jiro, name on a faded sign with half its lightbulbs gone. Beyond that was a vaping store. “The place next door is good?” He laughed. “You San Francisco motherfuckers got terrible LA restaurant radar. Put Sushi Jiro in the Mission and it’d have a Michelin star and a six-­month waiting list. Here it’s in a strip mall and only the locals know how good it is. Bet you never had a decent meal in this town, am I right?” “I’ve had a few,” I said, “but I admit my track record isn’t great.” “Let’s improve it.” The sushi was amazing. # Inglewood Jams had the kind of books that were performatively bad, designed to foil any attempt at human comprehension. But whoever cooked them was an amateur, someone who mistook complexity for obfuscation. Like cross-­referencing was a species of transcendentally esoteric sorcery. I don’t mind cross-referencing. It’s meditative, like playing solitaire. I had Bene­detto send over some colored post-­it tabs and a big photocopier with an automatic feeder and I started making piles. One night, I worked later than I planned. Sushi Jiro was becoming a serious hazard to my waistline and my sleep-­debt, because when your dinner break is ten yards and two doors away from your desk, it’s just too damned easy to get back to work after dinner. That night, I’d fallen into a cross-­referencing reverie, and before I knew it, it was 2 a.m., my lower back was groaning, and my eyes were stinging. I straightened, groaned, and slid my laptop into my bag. I found my keys and unlocked the door. The storefront was covered with brown butcher’s paper, but it didn’t go all the way to the edge. I had just a moment to sleepily note that there was some movement visible through the crack in the paper over the glass door when it came flying back toward me, bouncing off my toe, mostly, and my nose, a little. I put my one hand to my face as I instinctively threw myself into the door to close it again. I was too late and too tired. A strong shoulder on the other side of the doorframe pushed it open and I stumbled back, and then the guy was on me, the door sighing shut behind him on its gas lift as he bore me to the ground and straddled my chest, a move he undertook with the ease of much practice. He pinned my arms under his knees and then gave me a couple of hard hits, one to the jaw, one to the nose. My lip and nose were bleeding freely and my head was ringing from the hits and from getting smacked into the carpet tiles over concrete when I went down backward. I struggled—­to free my arms, to buck off my attacker, to focus on him. He was a beefy white guy in his late fifties, with watery dark eyes and a patchy shave that showed gray mixed in with his dark stubble. As he raised his fist for another blow, I saw that he was wearing a big class ring. A minute later, that ring opened my cheek, just under the orbit of my eye. Apart from some involuntary animal grunts, I hadn’t made a sound. Now I did. “Ow!” I shouted. “Shit!” I shouted. “Stop!” I shouted. He split my lip again. I bucked hard but I couldn’t budge him. He had a double chin, a gut, and he was strong, and used that bulk to back up his strength. It was like trying to free myself from under a boulder. That kept punching me in the face. The strip mall would be deserted. Everything was closed, even the vaping store. Shouting wouldn’t help. I did it anyway. He shut my mouth for me with a left. I gagged on blood. He took a break from punching me in the face, then. I think he was tired. His chest heaved, and he wiped sweat off his lip with the back of his hand, leaving behind a streaky mustache of my blood. He contemplated me, weighing me up. I thought maybe he was trying to decide if I had any fight left in me, or perhaps whether I had any valuables he could help himself to. He cleared his throat and looked at me again. “Goddammit, I messed your face up so bad I can’t tell for sure. I hope to fuck that you’re Martin Hench, though.” Even with my addled wits, this was an important piece of intelligence: he came here for me. This wasn’t a random act of senseless Los Angeles street violence. This was aimed at me. I was briefly angry at Benedetto for not warning me that Chuy Flores was such a tough son of a bitch. Then I had the presence of mind to lie. “I don’t know who the fuck this Mark Hendricks is.” My voice was thick with gargled blood, but I was proud of Mark Hendricks. Pretty fast thinking for a guy with a probable concussion. The guy slapped me open-­handed across the face, and as I lay dazed for a moment, he shifted, reached into my back pocket for my wallet, and yanked it—­and the seat of my pants—­free. Before I could react, his knees were back on my biceps, pinning my arms and shoulders. It was a very neat move, and fast for an old guy like him. He flipped my wallet open and squinted at it, then held it at arm’s length, then smiled broadly. He had bleach-­white teeth, a row of perfectly uniform caps. Los fucking Angeles, where even the thugs have a million-­dollar smile. “Shoulda sprung for botox,” I slurred. His grin got wider. “Maybe someday I will. Got these in trade from a cosmetic dentist I did some work for.” He dropped my wallet. “Listen, Martin Hench, you stay the fuck away from Thames Estuary and Lawrence Coleman.” “It’s Lionel Coleman,” I said. “What the fuck ever,” he said. He labored to his feet. I stayed still. He looked at me from a great height, and I stared up his nostrils. Without warning, he kicked my ribs hard enough that I heard one of them crack. “You’ve been told,” he said to my writhing body, and let himself out.

<h1>Google reneged on the monopolistic bargain (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/21/im-feeling-unlucky/#not-up-to-the-task">permalink</a>)</h1>
<p>A funny thing happened on the way to the enshittocene: Google &#8211; which astonished the world when it reinvented search, blowing Altavista and Yahoo out of the water with a search tool that seemed <em>magic</em> &#8211; suddenly turned into a pile of shit.</p>
<p>Google's search results are terrible. The top of the page is dominated by spam, scams, and ads. A surprising number of those ads <em>are</em> scams. Sometimes, these are high-stakes scams played out by well-resourced adversaries who stand to make a fortune by tricking Google:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/phone-numbers-airlines-listed-google-directed-scammers-rcna94766">https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/phone-numbers-airlines-listed-google-directed-scammers-rcna94766</a></p>
<p>But often these scams are perpetrated by petty grifters who are making a couple bucks at this. These aren't hyper-resourced, sophisticated attackers. They're the SEO equivalent of script kiddies, and they're running circles around Google:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/24/passive-income/#swiss-cheese-security">https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/24/passive-income/#swiss-cheese-security</a></p>
<p>Google search is empirically worsening. The SEO industry spends every hour that god sends trying to figure out how to sleaze their way to the top of the search results, and even if Google defeats 99% of these attempts, the 1% that squeak through end up dominating the results page for any consequential query:</p>
<p><a href="https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf">https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf</a></p>
<p>Google insists that this isn't true, and if it is true, it's not their fault because the bad guys out there are so numerous, dedicated and inventive that Google can't help but be overwhelmed by them:</p>
<p><a href="https://searchengineland.com/is-google-search-getting-worse-389658">https://searchengineland.com/is-google-search-getting-worse-389658</a></p>
<p>It wasn't supposed to be this way. Google has long maintained that its scale is the only thing that keeps us safe from the scammers and spammers who would otherwise overwhelm any lesser-resourced defender. That's why it was so imperative that they pursue such aggressive growth, buying up hundreds of companies and integrating their products with search so that every mobile device, every ad, every video, every website, had one of Google's tendrils in it.</p>
<p>This is the argument that Google's defenders have put forward in their messaging on the long-overdue antitrust case against Google, where we learned that Google is spending $26b/year to make sure you never try another search engine:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/google-paid-26-3-billion-to-be-default-search-engine-in-2021">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/google-paid-26-3-billion-to-be-default-search-engine-in-2021</a></p>
<p>Google, we were told, had achieved such intense scale that the normal laws of commercial and technological physics no longer applied. Take security: it's an iron law that "there is no security in obscurity." A system that is only secure when its adversaries don't understand how it works is not a secure system. As Bruce Schneier says, "anyone can design a security system that they themselves can't break. That doesn't mean it works &#8211; just that it works for people stupider than <em>them</em>."</p>
<p>And yet, Google operates one of the world's most consequential security system &#8211; The Algorithm (TM) &#8211; in total secrecy. We're not allowed to know how Google's ranking system works, what its criteria are, or even when it changes: "If we told you that, the spammers would win."</p>
<p>Well, they kept it a secret, and the spammers won anyway.</p>
<p>A viral post by Housefresh &#8211; who review air purifiers &#8211; describes how Google's algorithmic failures, which send the worst sites to the top of the heap, have made it impossible for high-quality review sites to compete:</p>
<p><a href="https://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/">https://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/</a></p>
<p>You've doubtless encountered these bad review sites. Search for "Best ______ 2024" and the results are a series of near-identical lists, strewn with Amazon affiliate links. Google has endlessly tinkered with its guidelines and algorithmic weights for review sites, and none of it has made a difference. For example, when Google instituted a policy that reviewers should "discuss the benefits and drawbacks of something, based on your own original research," sites that had previously regurgitated the same lists of the same top ten Amazon bestsellers "peppered their pages with references to a ‘rigorous testing process,’ their ‘lab team,’ subject matter experts ‘they collaborated with,’ and complicated methodologies that seem impressive at a cursory look."</p>
<p>But these grandiose claims &#8211; like the 67 air purifiers supposedly tested in <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em>'s Des Moines lab &#8211; result in zero in-depth reviews and no published data. Moreover, these claims to rigorous testing materialized within a few days of Google changing its search ranking and said that high rankings would be reserved for sites that did testing.</p>
<p>Most damning of all is how the <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em> top air purifiers perform in comparison to the &#8211; extensively documented &#8211; tests performed by Housefresh: "plagued by high-priced and underperforming units, Amazon bestsellers with dubious origins (that also underperform), and even subpar devices from companies that market their products with phrases like ‘the Tesla of air purifiers.’"</p>
<p>One of the top ranked items on <em>BH&amp;G</em> comes from Molekule, a company that filed for bankruptcy after being sued for false advertising. The model <em>BH&amp;G</em> chose was ranked "the worst air purifier tested" by Wirecutter and "not living up to the hype" by <em>Consumer Reports</em>. Either <em>BH&amp;G</em>'s rigorous testing process is a fiction that they infused their site with in response to a Google policy change, or <em>BH&amp;G</em> absolutely <em>sucks</em> at rigorous testing.</p>
<p><em>BH&amp;G</em>'s competitors commit the same sins &#8211; literally, the <em>exact</em> same sins. <em>Real Simple</em>'s reviews list the same photographer and the photos seem to have been taken in the same place. They also list the same person as their "expert." <em>Real Simple</em> has the same corporate parent as <em>BH&amp;G</em>: Dotdash Meredith. As Housefresh shows, there's a <em>lot</em> of Dotdash Meredith review photos that seem to have been taken in the same place, by the same person.</p>
<p>But the competitors of these magazines are no better. Buzzfeed lists <em>22</em> air purifiers, including that crapgadget from Molekule. Their "methodology" is to include screenshots of Amazon reviews.</p>
<p>A lot of the top ranked sites for air purifiers are once-great magazines that have been bought and enshittified by private equity giants, like <em>Popular Science</em>, which began as a magazine in 1872 and became a shambling zombie in 2023, after its PE owners North Equity LLC decided its googlejuice was worth more than its integrity and turned it into a metastatic chumbox of shitty affiliate-link SEO-bait. As Housefresh points out, the marketing team that runs <em>PopSci</em> makes a lot of hay out of the 150 years of trust that went into the magazine, but the actual reviews are thin anaecdotes, unbacked by even the pretense of empiricism (oh, and they <em>loooove</em> Molekule).</p>
<p>Some of the biggest, most powerful, most trusted publications in the world have a side-hustle in quietly producing SEO-friendly "10 Best ___________ of 2024" lists: <em>Rolling Stone</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, <em>US News and Report</em>, <em>CNN</em>, <em>New York Magazine</em>, <em>CNN</em>, <em>CNET</em>, <em>Tom's Guide</em>, and more.</p>
<p>Google literally has one job: to detect this kind of thing and crush it. The deal we made with Google was, "You monopolize search and use your monopoly rents to ensure that we never, ever try another search engine. In return, you will somehow distinguish between low-effort, useless nonsense and good information. You promised us that  if you got to be the unelected, permanent overlord of all information access, you would 'organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.'"</p>
<p>They broke the deal.</p>
<p>Companies like CNET <em>used</em> to do real, rigorous product reviews. As Housefresh points out, CNET once bought an <em>entire smart home</em> and used it to test products. Then Red Ventures bought CNET and bet that they could sell the house, switch to vibes-based reviewing, and that Google wouldn't even notice. They were right.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/welcome-to-the-cnet-smart-home/">https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/welcome-to-the-cnet-smart-home/</a></p>
<p>Google downranks sites that spend money and time on reviews like Housefresh and GearLab, and crams botshittened content mills like <em>BH&amp;G</em> into our eyeballs instead.</p>
<p>In 1558, Thomas Gresham coined (ahem) Gresham's Law: "Bad money drives out good." When counterfeit money circulates in the economy, anyone who gets a dodgy coin spends it as quickly as they can, because the longer you hold it, the greater the likelihood that someone will detect the fraud and the coin will become worthless. Run this system long enough and all the money in circulation is funny money.</p>
<p>An internet run by Google has its own Gresham's Law: bad sites drive out good. It's not just that <em>BH&amp;G</em> can "test" products at a fraction of the cost of Housefresh &#8211; through the simple expedient of doing inadequate tests or no tests at all &#8211; so they can put a lot more content up that Housefresh. But that alone wouldn't let them drive Housefresh off the front page of Google's search results. For that, <em>BH&amp;G</em> has to mobilize some of their savings from the no test/bad test lab to do <em>real</em> rigorous science: science in defeating Google's security-through-obscurity system, which lets them command the front page despite publishing worse-than-useless nonsense.</p>
<p>Google has lost the spam wars. In response to the plague of botshit clogging Google search results, the company has invested in&#8230;making more botshit:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/16/tweedledumber/#easily-spooked">https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/16/tweedledumber/#easily-spooked</a></p>
<p>Last year, Google did a $70b stock buyback. They also laid off 12,000 staffers (whose salaries could have been funded for 27 years by that stock buyback). They just laid off thousands more employees.</p>
<p>That wasn't the deal. The deal was that Google would get a monopoly, and they would spend their monopoly rents to be so good that you could just click "I'm feeling lucky" and be teleported to the very best response to your query. A company that can't figure out the difference between a scam like <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em> and a rigorous review site like Housefresh should be pouring every spare dime it brings in into <em>fixing this problem</em>. Not buying default search status on every platform so that we never try another search engine: they should be <em>fixing their shit</em>.</p>
<p>When Google admits that it's losing the war to these kack-handed spam-farmers, that's frustrating. When they light $26b/year on fire making sure you don't ever get to try anything else, that's <em>very</em> frustrating. When they vaporize <em>seventy billion dollars</em> on financial engineering and shoot one in ten engineers, that's <em>outrageous</em>.</p>
<p>Google's scale <em>has</em> transcended the laws of business physics: they can sell an ever-degrading product and command an ever-greater share of our economy, even as their incompetence dooms any decent, honest venture to obscurity while providing fertile ground &#8211; and endless temptation &#8211; for scammers.</p>

<h1>The Bezzle excerpt (Part IV) (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/21/im-feeling-unlucky/#poacher-turned-keeper">permalink</a>)</h1>
<p>This week marks the publication of my latest novel, <em>The Bezzle</em>, and to celebrate, I'm serializing an excerpt from Chapter 14 in six parts:</p>
<p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle</a></p>
<p><em>The Bezzle</em> is a revenge story, a crime novel, and a technothriller. It stars Martin Hench, a hard-fighting forensic accountant who specializes in unwinding high-tech scams. Hench made his debt in last year's <em>Red Team Blues</em> (now in paperback!); <em>The Bezzle</em> is a standalone followup:</p>
<p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865854/redteamblues">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865854/redteamblues</a></p>
<p>The serial tells the tale of Stefon Magner, AKA Steve Soul, a once-famous R&amp;B frontman whose disintegrating career turned to tragedy when his crooked manager forged his signature on a rights assignment contract that let him steal all of Stefon's royalties, which ballooned after modern hiphop artists discovered his grooves and started buying licenses to sample them. The first three installments related the sad circumstances of Stefon's life, and the real-world analogues (like Leonard Cohen and George Clinton, both of whom were pauperized by sticky-fingered managers) as well as one real-world countermeasure, copyright termination, a thing that more artists should know about and use:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/26/take-it-back/">https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/26/take-it-back/</a></p>
<p>Today's installment weaves in a major subplot for the first time in the serial: Los Angeles's notorious, murderous Sheriff's Deputy gangs. These are another unbelievable true tale: for decades, the LASD's deputies have formed themselves into criminal gangs, some of which require that initiates murder someone to be inducted:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LASD_deputy_gangs">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LASD_deputy_gangs</a></p>
<p>They sport gang tattoos, have secret signs, and run vast criminal enterprises. This has been the subject of numerous investigative press reports, and one extensive official report that called the gangs "a cancer":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/deputy-gangs-cancer-los-angeles-county-sheriffs-department-scathing-re-rcna73367">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/deputy-gangs-cancer-los-angeles-county-sheriffs-department-scathing-re-rcna73367</a></p>
<p>The sordid tales of the LASD gangs beggar belief. For example, deputies in charge of LA County jails forced inmates to pit-fight and took bets on the outcomes:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aclu.org/publications/report-cruel-and-usual-punishment-how-savage-gang-deputies-controls-la-county-jails">https://www.aclu.org/publications/report-cruel-and-usual-punishment-how-savage-gang-deputies-controls-la-county-jails</a></p>
<p>The taxpayers of LA have shelled out tens of millions of dollars to settle claims against LA's criminals with badges:</p>
<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/deputies-accused-being-secret-societies-230851807.html">https://news.yahoo.com/deputies-accused-being-secret-societies-230851807.html</a></p>
<p>Periodically, LA judges and officials will insist that they are tackling the problem:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-17/dozens-of-lasd-deputies-ordered-to-show-suspected-gang-tattoos-reveal-others-who-have-them">https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-17/dozens-of-lasd-deputies-ordered-to-show-suspected-gang-tattoos-reveal-others-who-have-them</a></p>
<p>But at every turn, the LA police "unions" manage to crush these investigations:</p>
<p><a href="https://abc7.com/los-angeles-county-lasd-deputy-gangs-cliques/13492081/">https://abc7.com/los-angeles-county-lasd-deputy-gangs-cliques/13492081/</a></p>
<p>And top cops are right there with them, insisting that these aren't "gangs" &#8211; they're just "subgroups":</p>
<p><a href="https://lapublicpress.org/2024/01/former-la-sheriff-villanueva-sheriffs-gangs-are-just-subgroups/">https://lapublicpress.org/2024/01/former-la-sheriff-villanueva-sheriffs-gangs-are-just-subgroups/</a></p>
<p>It's very weird being an Angeleno and knowing that one of the largest, most militarized, best funded police departments in the world has been openly captured by a hyperviolent crime syndicate. When I was in the Skyboat Media studios last December with Wil Wheaton recording the audiobook for <em>The Bezzle</em>, Wil broke off from reading to say, "You know, someone's going to read this and google it and have their mind blown when they discover that it's real":</p>
<p><a href="https://sowl.co/8nyGh">https://sowl.co/8nyGh</a></p>
<p>That's one of my favorite ways to turn literature into something more than entertainment. It's why I filled the <em>Little Brother</em> books with real-world surveillance, cryptography and security tech, giving enough detail to advance the plot <em>and</em> give readers an idea of what search terms would let them understand and use the concepts in the novel. That's something I'm happy to keep up with the <em>Hench</em> novels, unpicking the inner workings of scams and corruption.

<p>And now, onto part four!</p>
<p><center> * * *</center></p>
<p>The last of the boxes had been shelved.</p>
<p>Benedetto rose from his chair. “Thank you, gentlemen,” he said to the movers, and dug a roll of twenties out of his pocket and handed each of them two of their own. He turned to me as they filed out. “You wanna get sushi? The place next door is <em>great</em>.”</p>
<p>The empty storefront was in a down-­at-­heels strip mall in Eagle Rock. On one side, there was a Brazilian jujitsu studio that never seemed to have any students training in it. On the other side was Sushi Jiro, name on a faded sign with half its lightbulbs gone. Beyond that was a vaping store.</p>
<p>“The place next door is <em>good</em>?”</p>
<p>He laughed. “You San Francisco motherfuckers got terrible LA restaurant radar. Put Sushi Jiro in the Mission and it’d have a Michelin star and a six-­month waiting list. Here it’s in a strip mall and only the locals know how good it is. Bet you never had a decent meal in this town, am I right?”</p>
<p>“I’ve had a few,” I said, “but I admit my track record isn’t great.”</p>
<p>“Let’s improve it.”</p>
<p>The sushi was amazing.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Inglewood Jams had the kind of books that were <em>performatively</em> bad, designed to foil any attempt at human comprehension.</p>
<p>But whoever cooked them was an amateur, someone who mistook <em>complexity</em> for <em>obfuscation</em>. Like <em>cross-­referencing</em> was a species of transcendentally esoteric sorcery. I don’t mind cross-referencing. It’s meditative, like playing solitaire. I had Bene­detto send over some colored post-­it tabs and a big photocopier with an automatic feeder and I started making piles.</p>
<p>One night, I worked later than I planned. Sushi Jiro was becoming a serious hazard to my waistline and my sleep-­debt, because when your dinner break is ten yards and two doors away from your desk, it’s just too damned easy to get back to work after dinner.</p>
<p>That night, I’d fallen into a cross-­referencing reverie, and before I knew it, it was 2 a.m., my lower back was groaning, and my eyes were stinging.</p>
<p>I straightened, groaned, and slid my laptop into my bag. I found my keys and unlocked the door. The storefront was covered with brown butcher’s paper, but it didn’t go all the way to the edge. I had just a moment to sleepily note that there was some movement visible through the crack in the paper over the glass door when it came flying back toward me, bouncing off my toe, mostly, and my nose, a little. I put my one hand to my face as I instinctively threw myself into the door to close it again.</p>
<p>I was too late and too tired. A strong shoulder on the other side of the doorframe pushed it open and I stumbled back, and then the guy was on me, the door sighing shut behind him on its gas lift as he bore me to the ground and straddled my chest, a move he undertook with the ease of much practice. He pinned my arms under his knees and then gave me a couple of hard hits, one to the jaw, one to the nose.</p>
<p>My lip and nose were bleeding freely and my head was ringing from the hits and from getting smacked into the carpet tiles over concrete when I went down backward. I struggled—­to free my arms, to buck off my attacker, to focus on him.</p>
<p>He was a beefy white guy in his late fifties, with watery dark eyes and a patchy shave that showed gray mixed in with his dark stubble. As he raised his fist for another blow, I saw that he was wearing a big class ring. A minute later, that ring opened my cheek, just under the orbit of my eye.</p>
<p>Apart from some involuntary animal grunts, I hadn’t made a sound. Now I did. “Ow!” I shouted. “Shit!” I shouted. “Stop!” I shouted.</p>
<p>He split my lip again. I bucked hard but I couldn’t budge him. He had a double chin, a gut, and he was strong, and used that bulk to back up his strength. It was like trying to free myself from under a boulder. That kept punching me in the face.</p>
<p>The strip mall would be deserted. Everything was closed, even the vaping store.</p>
<p>Shouting wouldn’t help. I did it anyway. He shut my mouth for me with a left. I gagged on blood.</p>
<p>He took a break from punching me in the face, then. I think he was tired. His chest heaved, and he wiped sweat off his lip with the back of his hand, leaving behind a streaky mustache of my blood.</p>
<p>He <em>contemplated</em> me, weighing me up. I thought maybe he was trying to decide if I had any fight left in me, or perhaps whether I had any valuables he could help himself to.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat and looked at me again. “Goddammit, I messed your face up so bad I can’t tell for sure. I hope to fuck that you’re Martin Hench, though.”</p>
<p>Even with my addled wits, this was an important piece of intelligence: <em>he came here for me</em>. This wasn’t a random act of senseless Los Angeles street violence. This was aimed at <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>I was briefly angry at Benedetto for not warning me that Chuy Flores was such a tough son of a bitch. Then I had the presence of mind to lie.</p>
<p>“I don’t know who the fuck this Mark Hendricks is.” My voice was thick with gargled blood, but I was proud of <em>Mark Hendricks</em>. Pretty fast thinking for a guy with a probable concussion. The guy slapped me open-­handed across the face, and as I lay dazed for a moment, he shifted, reached into my back pocket for my wallet, and yanked it—­and the seat of my pants—­free. Before I could react, his knees were back on my biceps, pinning my arms and shoulders. It was a very neat move, and fast for an old guy like him.</p>
<p>He flipped my wallet open and squinted at it, then held it at arm’s length, then smiled broadly. He had bleach-­white teeth, a row of perfectly uniform caps. Los fucking Angeles, where even the thugs have a million-­dollar smile.</p>
<p>“Shoulda sprung for botox,” I slurred.</p>
<p>His grin got wider. “Maybe someday I will. Got these in trade from a cosmetic dentist I did some work for.” He dropped my wallet. “Listen, Martin Hench, you stay the fuck away from Thames Estuary and Lawrence Coleman.”</p>
<p>“It’s Lionel Coleman,” I said.</p>
<p>“What the fuck ever,” he said. He labored to his feet. I stayed still. He looked at me from a great height, and I stared up his nostrils. Without warning, he kicked my ribs hard enough that I heard one of them crack.</p>
<p>“You’ve been told,” he said to my writhing body, and let himself out.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links Pluralistic is four: Reflections on four years of Memex Method, Phase II. The Bezzle excerpt (Part III): In which Steve Soul lawyers up. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Pluralistic is four (permalink) Four years ago, I started pluralistic.net, my post-Boing Boing, solo blog project: an ad-free, tracker-free site that anyone can republish, commercially or noncommercially. It's been a wild four years, featuring over 1,150 editions, many consisting of multiple articles: https://pluralistic.net/2020/02/19/pluralist-19-feb-2020/ As a project, Pluralistic has been a roaring success. I've published multiple, significant "breakout" articles that popularized obscure, important, highly technical ideas, most notably "adversarial interoperability": http://pluralistic.net/tag/adversarial-interoperability "End-to-end" as a remedy for multiple internet ripoffs, including as a superior alternative to link-taxes as a means of saving the news industry from Big Tech predation: https://pluralistic.net/tag/e2e/ and, of course, "enshittification": https://pluralistic.net/tag/enshittification/ These are emblematic of the sorts of ideas that I've spent the past 20+ years trying to popularize in tech-policy debates dominated by technologically illiterate policy ideas ("abolish Section 230!") and politically illiterate technical ideas (so many to choose from, but let's just say "cryptocurrency"). They require that the reader come along for a lot of cross-disciplinary analysis that often gets deep into the weeds. These are some of the hardest ideas to convey, but nuanced proposals and critiques that work on both political and technical axes are the best hope we have of successfully weathering the polycrisis. Blogging has always been a part of this project. For nearly 20 years, I posted nearly every day on Boing Boing &#8211; 53,906 posts in all! &#8211; taking note of everything that seemed important. Keeping a "writer's notebook" in public imposes an unbeatable rigor, since you can't slack off and leave notes so brief and cryptic that they neither lodge in your subconscious nor form a record clear enough to refer to in future. By contrast, keeping public notes produces both a subconscious, supersaturated solution of fragmentary ideas that rattle around, periodically cohering into nucleii that crystallize into full-blown ideas for stories, novels, essays, speeches and nonfiction books. What's more, those ripened ideas are supported by a searchable database of everything I've thought about the subject, often annotated by readers and other writers who've commented on the posts. I call this "The Memex Method": https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/ Pluralistic marks a new phase in my deployment of the Memex Method. With 50K+ notes in a database, I've gradually turned Pluralistic into a forum for far more synthetic, longer-form work that pulls on threads from decades of research into nothing in particular and everything that seemed important. Pluralistic is also an experiment in retaining control over my destiny &#8211; but not my work. Rather than hitching my ability to reach an audience through a platform that can be enshittified at the whim of a mercurial, infantile billionaire or their venal, callous shareholders, Pluralistic is published web-first, on a site I control, and then syndicated to every platform that matters to me. It's a process called POSSE (Post Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere): https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd I want to spread the ideas I fight for, so I post them everywhere, and license them Creative Commons Attribution-Only, encouraging others to repost them. Lots of small sites do this, but so do large ones. Notably, Wired picked up my first breakout piece on enshittification and republished it under the CC terms: https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/ This was a really interesting process. On the one hand, I didn't get paid for this feature, which did really well for Wired. On the other hand, nearly 30 years of writing for Wired makes me doubtful that I could have gotten this piece out in the form it emerged, without substantially toning down (or, if you prefer, neutering) the rhetoric that made that piece more persuasive. A commissioning editor from one of the largest newspapers in the world got in touch with me after it came out and said they wished they'd published it &#8211; but also that they knew they couldn't possibly have done so. By publishing the story first on my blog, proving its audience, and establishing its canonical form, I was able to get it amplified by a service with a much bigger platform than me, without having to compromise on the form. That republication gave me the much-maligned "exposure" &#8211; but it also carried the message to places it wouldn't have reached on its own. I don't write &#8211; have never written &#8211; solely as an income source. As both an artist and an activist, connecting with audiences has always been co-equal in my mind with earning my living. That's why I don't do a lot of film-writing: it pays well, but most of it never sees the light of day. It's also why I stopped writing for ad agencies: it paid well, but it didn't matter to me or my audience. To mangle Dr Johnson: "No man but a blockhead ever wrote solely for money." The open nature of this blog, with its many open syndication channels, creates multidirectional pathways for evaluating and refining my attempts at making my ideas understood and my art land. My posts often circle back to points I made earlier, incorporating useful feedback from readers and colleagues, sure, but also anticipating and rebutting those areas where critics have convinced others in various forums. Vanity searching is unjustly maligned: I learn a ton about how to make by work better by lurking in Reddit comments, Hacker News, Twitter, Slashdot, Metafilter and other forums. I also take a sneaky pleasure in knowing that the persistent trolls who reliably pop up to grind their weird axes about me (sometimes referencing blog posts I made decades ago) have taught me how to neutralize them in advance, and it's delightful to see them try their same old lines, only to have other commentators point out that my latest piece makes it absolutely undeniable how wrong they are. Living well is the best revenge, indeed. Four years. I've been writing Pluralistic for four years. During that time, I've published eight books &#8211; and beyond any doubt, Pluralistic helped me get those books into readers' hands. But far more importantly, during that time, I've written nine books &#8211; and contracted for a tenth &#8211; as the Memex Method paid off again and again. I don't know how long I'll do Pluralistic for, but I don't foresee stopping any time soon. What's more, no matter what happens to Pluralistic, I can't ever see giving up on the Memex Method, keeping notes in public and making them work for me. The Bezzle excerpt (Part III) (permalink) This week, I'm serializing part of chapter 14 from my new novel The Bezzle, which is out in stores TODAY (!!!): https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle The Bezzle is a Martin Hench novel, the followup to last year's Red Team Blues &#8211; though each book in the series is designed to be read in any order, and to stand alone (RTB just came out in paperback): https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865854/redteamblues Hench is a two-fisted, high-tech forensic accountant whose career spans 40 years of busting high-tech scams, from the earliest days of the PC to the white-hot center of the cryptocurrency bubble. Each book revolves around a single, central scam (in The Bezzle, it's the unbelievably slimy prison-tech industry): https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/14/minnesota-nice/#shitty-technology-adoption-curve But each book also features lots of subplots that unpick different kinds of fraud. In this serialized excerpt, we get to watch Marty unwind a music royalty theft scheme, the kind of thing that Rebecca Giblin and I pulled apart in our 2022 book, Chokepoint Capitalism (also now in paperback!): https://chokepointcapitalism.com/ Today's installment gets into one of the major tactics of any semi-respectable scam &#8211; simply ignoring the victim in the hope that they'll get tired and go away. Any of us who've been ripped off by a big company can surely relate. I'm leaving on my tour for this one tomorrow, starting with a gig in Salt Lake City at Weller Bookworks (Feb 21) at 630PM: https://www.wellerbookworks.com/event/store-cory-doctorow-feb-21-630-pm From there, it's on to LA (with Adam Conover), Seattle (with Neal Stephenson) and many, many more cities &#8211; maybe one near you! https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/16/narrative-capitalism/#bezzle-tour Here's part one of the serial: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/17/the-steve-soul-caper/#lead-singer-disease And part two: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/19/crad-kilodney-was-an-outlier/#copyright-termination And now, onto part three! * * * Stefon cooked Jamal another dinner and Jamal wrote another letter, this one more forceful, and addressed to Gounder by name. Two weeks later, Jamal wrote another letter without needing dinner because “that motherfucker went to Harvard fucking law”—­Jamal had looked him up in the ALA directory—­“and he knows you can’t make legal problems go away just by ignoring them. Time for that piece of shit to put on his big-­boy pants and be a goddamned lawyer.” The one thing Jamal wouldn’t do was file a lawsuit. “You need a lawyer for that,” he said. “I mean, I can help you with the paperwork, but a paralegal can’t file the suit. And you shouldn’t file your own suit, either. Those guys’ll just hire some blow-dried asshole from a big law firm and they’ll crush you like a cockroach.” “Well, shit,” Stefon said. But it all made sense. Anyone doing business with Chuy Flores would do business like Chuy Flores—­that is, crooked as hell. “What you need is a contingency lawyer,” Jamal said. “Someone who’ll take the job for a piece of the action.” Which is how Stefon ended up being represented by Benny Caetani II, son of Benedetto Caetani, who graduated at the top of his Yale class, won a string of spectacular class-­action suits, then got disbarred after someone leaked calls where he admitted moving money from one client trust account into another to cover a shortfall. No one seriously thought that Benedetto was stealing anyone’s money—­he’d had receivables due within a week that let him make the trust account whole—­but he was also clearly guilty. Equally, no one seriously believed that the high-­powered surveillance that led to Benedetto’s downfall was random. Benedetto had transferred more than a hundred million dollars from the balance sheets of America’s largest, dirtiest corporations—­ poison-­peddling pharma giants, toxic-­waste-­dumping chemical companies, a global chain of botox parlors with some very loose syringes indeed—­and they were gunning for him. Officially, Benedetto was out of the lawyer game. Unofficially, he was the brains behind Benny, and the two of them ran a squeaky-­clean shop, making sure that everything that an actual lawyer had to do, Benny did—­while Benedetto did ­everything else. Father and son got along well and they were a hell of a team. When Benedetto called me in to audit Inglewood Jams’ books, I jumped at the opportunity. They were a delight to work for. “They played tough,” Benedetto said, as his minions arranged the bankers’ boxes on the steel kitchen shelves he’d had installed on the long walls of the storefront he’d rented for me to work out of for the month. “At first. Told me they didn’t owe Stefon a dime, and that they’d rather bankrupt themselves in court than pay some broken-­down, washed-­up disco king anything. Told me his problem was with Chuy, not Inglewood Jams.” “Well, to be fair, that Chuy guy sounds like a class-­A piece of shit.” “A broke piece of shit. Guy’s got a million-­dollar nose and an empty bank account.” “So you had to go after Inglewood Jams.” Benedetto twirled around in his Aeron chair. He’d sent over a pair of them, asking if I needed more, because he had a storage locker full of them that he’d gotten as part of a settlement with a broke Santa Monica crowdsourcing company that stiffed its workers when it folded. “I did. I went after them. That Gounder lawyer tried to bluff, then when that didn’t work, he tried to dodge service. Which was such a kindergarten move. Plus he was no good at it. Caught him outside the rub-­and-­tug parlor he went to every Friday after work. Handed him the papers. Wore a bodycam. Didn’t mention his wife. Didn’t have to.” “You think he settled because he didn’t want his wife to find out he was getting hand jobs at a massage parlor?” “No, he held out awhile after that. But I could see it preying on him, every time I was face-­to-­face with him. Eventually, he musta told his bosses that they were gonna lose, and so they offered a settlement. It was trash. I laughed in his face. He tossed out some better offers, but none of them even in the ballpark of what we would get in court. Finally, I told him to get serious or send his court suit out to the dry cleaner’s. That’s when he offered to make Stefon whole and pay me a little for my trouble on top of things.” I suppressed a snort. I was sure that a little on top amounted to some real folding money. “Even then he tried to pull a fast one, told me he’d calculate Stefon’s royalties and send a check the next week. I was like, ‘Hold up, there is no way you’re going to be able to make an honest accounting for Stefon’s royalties in a week. The dude’s samples are in hundreds of songs. The mere fact that you claimed that you could come up with a fair amount in a week tells me you were planning to pull a lowball number out of your ass and pass it off as the audited total, so tell you what, I’m gonna get the best forensic accountant in the state of California to come down here to LA and crawl all over your papers, and you are going to send him everything he needs to do it, or we’re going to court, motherfucker.” “And he agreed?” “Hell no. He refused. We went to a preliminary hearing. Judge turned out to be a classic soul fan. It didn’t go well for Gounder or Inglewood. The next day, he was back in my office, and now, well, here we are.” Hey look at this (permalink) Manulife reversed its pharmacy deal with Loblaw’s Shoppers Drug Mart – so what? https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-manulife-reversed-its-pharmacy-deal-with-loblaws-shoppers-drug-mart-so/ (h/t Regs to Riches) Are We Transitioning From Capitalism to Silicon Serfdom? https://jacobin.com/2024/02/yanis-varoufakis-techno-feudalism-capitalism-interview/ Every Time We Meet for Ice Cream Your Whole F*cking Face Explodes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orfDpGNh_kc (h/t Nelson Minar) This day in history (permalink) #20yrsago GreyTuesday: mass mirroring of the Grey Album https://web.archive.org/web/20040220061627/http://www.greytuesday.org/ #15yrsago Terry Pratchett gets a knighthood https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7896865.stm #15yrsago Irish cops finally “catch” Prawo Jazdy https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7899171.stm?lss #10yrsago Ukraine security forces torch #euromaidan’s IT tent, kill journalist, beat tech protester to near-death https://web.archive.org/web/20140302031342/http://it-namet.com.ua/news/zayava-it-spilnoti-shodo-podij-19-lyutogo #10yrsago Survivors of the Florida School for Boys return to the site of legal kidnapping, torture and murder of children https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/02/returning-to-dozier-florida-school-for-boys/ #10yrsago XKCD’s brilliant explanation of Fermi Estimation https://what-if.xkcd.com/84/ #10yrsago NH legislator introduces bill to stop small-town cops from buying tanks https://www.techdirt.com/2014/02/18/new-hampshire-state-legislator-hopes-to-push-back-against-police-militarization-with-new-bill/ #10yrsago Detailed analysis of Syria’s network censorship with logs from Blue Coat’s surveillance boxes https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3401.pdf #5yrsago Scientists finally explain why microwaved grapes emit glorious bursts of plasma https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1818350116 #5yrsago “We take your privacy and security seriously” is the “thoughts and prayers” of data-breaches https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/17/we-take-your-privacy-and-security-seriously/ #5yrsago Study suggests that Flat Eartherism spread via Youtube https://aaas.confex.com/aaas/2018/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/21432 #5yrsago Publisher of Alabama newspaper calls for the Klan to ride on DC with “hemp ropes” https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2019/02/18/alabama-newspaper-ku-klux-klan-to-night-ride-again-linden-democrat-reporter-goodloe-sutton/2910436002/ #5yrsago Ontario parliamentarian calls for Right to Repair legislation https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/02/18/ontario-mpp-right-repair/ #5yrsago EU Commission calls opponents of Copyright Directive a “mob,” as thousands take to the streets for the #Artikel13Demo https://torrentfreak.com/eu-commission-deletes-article-13-post-because-mob-understood-it-incorrectly-190218/N #1yrago Twiddler https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/ #1yrago Pluralistic is three https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/drei-drei-drei/#now-we-are-three Colophon (permalink) Today's top sources: Currently writing: A Little Brother short story about DIY insulin PLANNING Picks and Shovels, a Martin Hench noir thriller about the heroic era of the PC.

<h1>Pluralistic is four (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/20/fore/#synthesis">permalink</a>)</h1>
<p>Four years ago, I started pluralistic.net, my post-Boing Boing, solo blog project: an ad-free, tracker-free site that anyone can republish, commercially or noncommercially. It's been a wild four years, featuring over 1,150 editions, many consisting of multiple articles:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/02/19/pluralist-19-feb-2020/">https://pluralistic.net/2020/02/19/pluralist-19-feb-2020/</a></p>
<p>As a project, Pluralistic has been a <em>roaring</em> success. I've published multiple, significant "breakout" articles that popularized obscure, important, highly technical ideas, most notably "adversarial interoperability":</p>
<p><a href="http://pluralistic.net/tag/adversarial-interoperability">http://pluralistic.net/tag/adversarial-interoperability</a></p>
<p>"End-to-end" as a remedy for multiple internet ripoffs, including as a superior alternative to link-taxes as a means of saving the news industry from Big Tech predation:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/tag/e2e/">https://pluralistic.net/tag/e2e/</a></p>
<p>and, of course, "enshittification":</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/tag/enshittification/">https://pluralistic.net/tag/enshittification/</a></p>
<p>These are emblematic of the sorts of ideas that I've spent the past 20+ years trying to popularize in tech-policy debates dominated by technologically illiterate policy ideas ("abolish Section 230!") and politically illiterate technical ideas (so many to choose from, but let's just say "cryptocurrency"). They require that the reader come along for a lot of cross-disciplinary analysis that often gets <em>deep</em> into the weeds. These are some of the hardest ideas to convey, but nuanced proposals and critiques that work on both political and technical axes are the best hope we have of successfully weathering the polycrisis.</p>
<p>Blogging has always been a part of this project. For nearly 20 years, I posted nearly every day on Boing Boing &#8211; 53,906 posts in all! &#8211; taking note of everything that seemed important. Keeping a "writer's notebook" in public imposes an unbeatable rigor, since you can't slack off and leave notes so brief and cryptic that they neither lodge in your subconscious nor form a record clear enough to refer to in future. By contrast, keeping public notes produces both a subconscious, supersaturated solution of fragmentary ideas that rattle around, periodically cohering into nucleii that crystallize into full-blown ideas for stories, novels, essays, speeches and nonfiction books. What's more, those ripened ideas are supported by a searchable database of everything I've thought about the subject, often annotated by readers and other writers who've commented on the posts. I call this "The Memex Method":</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/">https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/</a></p>
<p>Pluralistic marks a new phase in my deployment of the Memex Method. With 50K+ notes in a database, I've gradually turned Pluralistic into a forum for far more synthetic, longer-form work that pulls on threads from decades of research into nothing in particular and everything that seemed important.</p>
<p>Pluralistic is also an experiment in retaining control over my destiny &#8211; but not my work. Rather than hitching my ability to reach an audience through a platform that can be enshittified at the whim of a mercurial, infantile billionaire or their venal, callous shareholders, Pluralistic is published web-first, on a site I control, and then syndicated to every platform that matters to me. It's a process called POSSE (Post Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd">https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd</a></p>
<p>I want to spread the ideas I fight for, so I post them everywhere, and license them Creative Commons Attribution-Only, encouraging others to repost them. Lots of small sites do this, but so do large ones. Notably, <em>Wired</em> picked up my first breakout piece on enshittification and republished it under the CC terms:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/</a></p>
<p>This was a really interesting process. On the one hand, I didn't get paid for this feature, which did <em>really</em> well for <em>Wired</em>. On the other hand, nearly 30 years of writing for <em>Wired</em> makes me doubtful that I <em>could</em> have gotten this piece out in the form it emerged, without substantially toning down (or, if you prefer, neutering) the rhetoric that made that piece more persuasive. A commissioning editor from one of the largest newspapers in the world got in touch with me after it came out and said they wished they'd published it &#8211; but also that they knew they couldn't possibly have done so. By publishing the story first on my blog, proving its audience, and establishing its canonical form, I was able to get it amplified by a service with a <em>much</em> bigger platform than me, without having to compromise on the form.</p>
<p>That republication gave me the much-maligned "exposure" &#8211; but it also carried the message to places it wouldn't have reached on its own. I don't write &#8211; have never written &#8211; solely as an income source. As both an artist and an activist, connecting with audiences has always been co-equal in my mind with earning my living. That's why I don't do a lot of film-writing: it pays well, but most of it never sees the light of day. It's also why I stopped writing for ad agencies: it paid well, but it didn't matter to me or my audience. To mangle Dr Johnson: "No man but a blockhead ever wrote <em>solely</em> for money."</p>
<p>The open nature of this blog, with its many open syndication channels, creates multidirectional pathways for evaluating and refining my attempts at making my ideas understood and my art land. My posts often circle back to points I made earlier, incorporating useful feedback from readers and colleagues, sure, but also anticipating and rebutting those areas where critics have convinced others in various forums. Vanity searching is unjustly maligned: I learn a <em>ton</em> about how to make by work better by lurking in Reddit comments, Hacker News, Twitter, Slashdot, Metafilter and other forums. I also take a sneaky pleasure in knowing that the persistent trolls who reliably pop up to grind their weird axes about me (sometimes referencing blog posts I made <em>decades ago</em>) have taught me how to neutralize them in advance, and it's delightful to see them try their same old lines, only to have other commentators point out that my latest piece makes it absolutely undeniable how wrong they are. Living well is the best revenge, indeed.</p>
<p>Four years. I've been writing Pluralistic for <em>four years</em>. During that time, I've published <em>eight</em> books &#8211; and beyond any doubt, Pluralistic helped me get those books into readers' hands. But far more importantly, during that time, I've <em>written nine books</em> &#8211; and contracted for a tenth &#8211; as the Memex Method paid off again and again.</p>
<p>I don't know how long I'll do Pluralistic for, but I don't foresee stopping any time soon. What's more, no matter what happens to Pluralistic, I can't <em>ever</em> see giving up on the Memex Method, keeping notes in public and making them work for me.</p>

<h1>The Bezzle excerpt (Part III) (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/20/fore/#lawyer-up">permalink</a>)</h1>
<p>This week, I'm serializing part of chapter 14 from my new novel <em>The Bezzle</em>, which is out in stores TODAY (!!!):</p>
<p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle</a></p>
<p><em>The Bezzle</em> is a Martin Hench novel, the followup to last year's <em>Red Team Blues</em> &#8211; though each book in the series is designed to be read in any order, and to stand alone (<em>RTB</em> just came out in paperback):</p>
<p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865854/redteamblues">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865854/redteamblues</a></p>
<p>Hench is a two-fisted, high-tech forensic accountant whose career spans 40 years of busting high-tech scams, from the earliest days of the PC to the white-hot center of the cryptocurrency bubble. Each book revolves around a single, central scam (in <em>The Bezzle</em>, it's the unbelievably slimy prison-tech industry):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/14/minnesota-nice/#shitty-technology-adoption-curve">https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/14/minnesota-nice/#shitty-technology-adoption-curve</a></p>
<p>But each book also features lots of subplots that unpick different kinds of fraud. In this serialized excerpt, we get to watch Marty unwind a music royalty theft scheme, the kind of thing that Rebecca Giblin and I pulled apart in our 2022 book, <em>Chokepoint Capitalism</em> (also now in paperback!):</p>
<p><a href="https://chokepointcapitalism.com/">https://chokepointcapitalism.com/</a></p>
<p>Today's installment gets into one of the major tactics of any semi-respectable scam &#8211; simply ignoring the victim in the hope that they'll get tired and go away. Any of us who've been ripped off by a big company can surely relate.</p>
<p>I'm leaving on my tour for this one tomorrow, starting with a gig in Salt Lake City at Weller Bookworks (Feb 21) at 630PM:</p>

<p>From there, it's on to LA (with Adam Conover), Seattle (with Neal Stephenson) and many, many more cities &#8211; maybe one near you!</p>

<p>Here's part one of the serial:</p>

<p>And part two:</p>

<p>And now, onto part three!</p>
<p><center> * * *</center></p>
<p>Stefon cooked Jamal another dinner and Jamal wrote another letter, this one more forceful, and addressed to Gounder by name. Two weeks later, Jamal wrote another letter without needing dinner because “that motherfucker went to Harvard fucking law”—­Jamal had looked him up in the ALA directory—­“and he knows you can’t make legal problems go away just by ignoring them. Time for that piece of shit to put on his big-­boy pants and be a goddamned <em>lawyer</em>.”</p>
<p>The one thing Jamal wouldn’t do was file a lawsuit. “You need a lawyer for that,” he said. “I mean, I can help you with the paperwork, but a paralegal can’t file the suit. And you shouldn’t file your own suit, either. Those guys’ll just hire some blow-dried asshole from a big law firm and they’ll crush you like a cockroach.”</p>
<p>“Well, shit,” Stefon said. But it all made sense. Anyone doing business <em>with</em> Chuy Flores would do business <em>like</em> Chuy Flores—­that is, crooked as hell.</p>
<p>“What you need is a <em>contingency</em> lawyer,” Jamal said. “Someone who’ll take the job for a piece of the action.” Which is how Stefon ended up being represented by Benny Caetani II, son of Benedetto Caetani, who graduated at the top of his Yale class, won a string of spectacular class-­action suits, then got disbarred after someone leaked calls where he admitted moving money from one client trust account into another to cover a shortfall. No one seriously thought that Benedetto was stealing anyone’s money—­he’d had receivables due within a week that let him make the trust account whole—­but he was also clearly guilty.</p>
<p>Equally, no one seriously believed that the high-­powered surveillance that led to Benedetto’s downfall was <em>random</em>. Benedetto had transferred more than a hundred million dollars from the balance sheets of America’s largest, dirtiest corporations—­ poison-­peddling pharma giants, toxic-­waste-­dumping chemical companies, a global chain of botox parlors with some very loose syringes indeed—­and they were gunning for him.</p>
<p>Officially, Benedetto was out of the lawyer game. Unofficially, he was the brains behind Benny, and the two of them ran a <em>squeaky-­clean</em> shop, making sure that everything that an actual lawyer had to do, Benny did—­while Benedetto did ­everything else. Father and son got along well and they were a hell of a team. When Benedetto called me in to audit Inglewood Jams’ books, I jumped at the opportunity. They were a delight to work for.</p>
<p>“They played tough,” Benedetto said, as his minions arranged the bankers’ boxes on the steel kitchen shelves he’d had installed on the long walls of the storefront he’d rented for me to work out of for the month. “At first. Told me they didn’t owe Stefon a dime, and that they’d rather bankrupt themselves in court than pay some broken-­down, washed-­up disco king anything. Told me his problem was with Chuy, not Inglewood Jams.”</p>
<p>“Well, to be fair, that Chuy guy sounds like a class-­A piece of shit.”</p>
<p>“A <em>broke</em> piece of shit. Guy’s got a million-­dollar nose and an empty bank account.”</p>
<p>“So you had to go after Inglewood Jams.”</p>
<p>Benedetto twirled around in his Aeron chair. He’d sent over a pair of them, asking if I needed more, because he had a storage locker full of them that he’d gotten as part of a settlement with a broke Santa Monica crowdsourcing company that stiffed its workers when it folded.</p>
<p>“I did. I went <em>after</em> them. That Gounder lawyer tried to bluff, then when that didn’t work, he tried to dodge service. Which was such a <em>kindergarten</em> move. Plus he was no good at it. Caught him outside the rub-­and-­tug parlor he went to every Friday after work. Handed him the papers. Wore a bodycam. Didn’t mention his wife. Didn’t have to.”</p>
<p>“You think he settled because he didn’t want his wife to find out he was getting hand jobs at a massage parlor?”</p>
<p>“No, he held out awhile after that. But I could see it preying on him, every time I was face-­to-­face with him. Eventually, he musta told his bosses that they were gonna lose, and so they offered a settlement. It was trash. I laughed in his face. He tossed out some better offers, but none of them even in the <em>ballpark</em> of what we would get in court. Finally, I told him to get serious or send his court suit out to the dry cleaner’s. That’s when he offered to make Stefon whole and pay me a little for my trouble on top of things.”</p>
<p>I suppressed a snort. I was sure that a little on top amounted to some real folding money.</p>
<p>“Even then he tried to pull a fast one, told me he’d calculate Stefon’s royalties and send a check the next week. I was like, ‘Hold <em>up</em>, there is no way you’re going to be able to make an honest accounting for Stefon’s royalties in a week. The dude’s samples are in <em>hundreds</em> of songs. The mere fact that you claimed that you could come up with a fair amount in a week tells me you were planning to pull a lowball number out of your ass and pass it off as the audited total, so tell you what, I’m gonna get the best forensic accountant in the state of California to come down here to LA and crawl all over your papers, and you are going to send him everything he needs to do it, or we’re going to <em>court</em>, motherfucker.”</p>
<p>“And he agreed?”</p>
<p>“Hell no. He <em>refused</em>. We went to a preliminary hearing. Judge turned out to be a classic soul fan. It didn’t go well for Gounder or Inglewood. The next day, he was back in my office, and now, well, here we are.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links Middlemen without enshittification: Not every author can be a DIY author. The Bezzle excerpt (Part II): Let's learn about copyright termination! Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Middlemen without enshittification (permalink) Enshittification describes how platforms go bad, which is also how the internet goes bad, because the internet is made of platforms, which is weird, because platforms are intermediaries and we were promised that the internet would disintermediate the world: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel The internet did disintermediate a hell of a lot of intermediaries &#8211; that is, "middlemen" &#8211; but then it created a bunch more of these middlemen, who coalesced into a handful of gatekeepers, or as the EU calls them "VLOPs" (Very Large Online Platforms, the most EU acronym ever). Which raises two questions: first, why did so many of us end up flocking to these intermediaries' sites, and how did those sites end up with so much power? To answer the first question, I want you to consider one of my favorite authors: Crad Kilodney (RIP): https://archive.org/details/thecradkilodneypapers When I was growing up, Crad was a fixture on the streets of Toronto. All through the day and late into the evening, winter or summer, Crad would stand on the street with a sign around his neck ("Very famous Canadian author, buy my books, $2" or sometimes just "Margaret Atwood, buy my books, $2"). He wrote these deeply weird, often very funny short stories, which he edited, typeset, printed, bound and sold himself, one at a time, to people who approached him on the street. I had a lot of conversations with Crad &#8211; as an aspiring writer, I was endlessly fascinated by him and his books. He was funny, acerbic &#8211; and sneaky. Crad wore a wire: he kept a hidden tape recorder rolling in his coat and he secretly recorded conversations with people like me, and then released a series of home-duplicated tapes of the weirdest and funniest ones: https://archive.org/details/on-the-street-crad-kilodney-vol-1 I love Crad. He deserves more recognition. There's an on-again/off-again documentary about his life and work that I hope gets made some day: https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/09/free-sample/#putrid-scum But &#8211; and this is the crucial part &#8211; there are writers out there I want to hear from who couldn't do what Crad did. Maybe they can write books, but not edit them. Or edit them, but not typeset them. Or typeset, but not print. Or print, but not spend the rest of their lives standing on a street-corner with a "PUTRID SCUM" sign around their neck. Which is fine. That's why we have intermediaries. I like booksellers (I was one!). I like publishers. I like distributors. I like their salesforce, who go forth and convince the booksellers of the world to stock books like mine. I have ten million things I want to do before I die, and I'm already 52, and being a sales-rep for a publisher isn't on my bucket list. I am so thankful that someone else wants to do this for me. That's why we have intermediaries, and why disintermediation always leads to some degree of re-intermediation. There's a lot of explicit and implicit knowledge and specialized skill required to connect buyers and sellers, creators and audiences, and other sides of two-sided markets. Some producers can do some of this stuff for themselves, and a very few &#8211; like Crad &#8211; can do it all, but most of us need some help, somewhere along the way. In the excellent 2022 book Direct, Kathryn Judge lays out a clear case for all the good that middlemen can do: https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/12/direct-the-problem-of-middlemen/ So why were we all so anxious for disintermediation back in the late 1990s? Here's a hint: it wasn't because we hated intermediaries &#8211; it was because we hated powerful intermediaries. The point of an intermediary is to serve as a conduit between producers and consumers, buyers and sellers, audiences and creators. When an intermediary gains power over the audience &#8211; say, by locking them inside a walled garden &#8211; and then uses that lock-in to screw producers and appropriate an ever larger share of the value going between them, that's when intermediaries become a problem. The problem isn't that someone will handle ticketing for your gig. The problem is that Ticketmaster has locked down all the ticketing, and the venues, and the promotions, and it uses that power to gouge fans and rip off artists: https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/20/anything-that-cant-go-on-forever-will-eventually-stop/ The problem isn't that there's a well-made website that lets you shop for goods sold by many small merchants and producers. It's that Amazon has cornered this market, takes $0.51 out of every dollar you spend there, and clones and destroys any small merchant who succeeds on the platform: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/25/greedflation/#commissar-bezos The problem isn't that there's a website where you can stream most of the music ever recorded. It's that Spotify colludes with the Big Three labels to rip off artists and sneaks crap you don't want to hear into your stream in order to collect payola: https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/12/streaming-doesnt-pay/#stunt-publishing The problem isn't that there's a website where you can buy any audiobook you want. It's that Amazon's Audible locks every book to its platform forever and steals hundreds of millions of dollars from creators: https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/25/can-you-hear-me-now/#acx-ripoff The problem, in other words, isn't intermediation &#8211; it's power. The thing that distinguishes a useful intermediary from an enshittified bully is power. Intermediaries gain power when our governments stop enforcing competition law. This lets intermediaries buy each other up and corner markets. Once they've formed cozy cartels, they can capture their regulators and commit rampant labor, privacy and consumer violations with impunity. That capture also lets them harness governments to punish smaller players that want to free workers, creators, audiences and customers from walled gardens. It also hands them a whip-hand over their workers, so that any worker who refuses to aid in these nefarious plans can be easily fired: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel A world with intermediaries is a better world. As much as I love Crad Kilodney's books, I wouldn't want to live in a world where the only books on my shelves came from people prepared to stand on a street-corner wearing a "FOUL PUS FROM DEAD DOGS" sign. The problem isn't intermediaries &#8211; it's powerful intermediaries. That's why the world's surging antitrust movement is so exciting: by reinstating competition law, we can keep intermediaries small and comparatively weak, so that creators and audiences, drivers and riders, sellers and buyers, and other groups seeking to connect will not find themselves made subservient to middlemen. The Bezzle excerpt (Part II) (permalink) Today, I'm bringing you part two of this week's serialized excerpt from The Bezzle, my new Martin Hench high-tech crime revenge thriller: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle Though most of the scams that Hench &#8211; a two-fisted forensic accountant specializing in Silicon Valley skullduggery &#8211; goes after in The Bezzle have a strong tech component, this excerpt concerns a pre-digital scam: music royalty theft. This is a subject that I got really deep into when researching and writing 2022's Chokepoint Capitalism &#8211; a manifesto for fixing creative labor markets: https://chokepointcapitalism.com/ My co-author on that book is Rebecca Giblin, who also happens to be one of the world's leading experts in "copyright termination" &#8211; the legal right of creative workers to claw back any rights they signed over after 35 years: https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/26/take-it-back/ This was enshrined in the 1976 Copyright Act, and has largely languished in obscurity since then, though recent years have seen creators of all kinds getting their rights back through termination &#8211; the authors of The Babysitters Club and Sweet Valley High Books, Stephen King, and George Clinton, to name a few. The estates of the core team at Marvel Comics, including Stan Lee, just settled a case that might have let them take the rights to all those characters back from Disney: https://www.thewrap.com/marvel-settles-spiderman-lawsuit-steve-ditko/ Copyright termination is a powerful tonic to the bargaining disparities between creative workers. A creative worker who signs a bad contract at the start of their career can &#8211; if they choose &#8211; tear that contract up 35 years later and demand a better one. Turning this into a plot-point in The Bezzle is the kind of thing that I love about this series &#8211; the ability to take important, obscure, technical aspects of how the world works and turn them into high-stakes technothriller storylines that bring them to the audience they deserve. If you signed something away 35 years ago and you want to get it back, try Rights Back, an automated termination of tranfer tool co-developed by Creative Commons and Authors Alliance (whose advisory board I volunteer on): https://rightsback.org/ All right, onto today's installment. Here's part one, published on Saturday: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/17/the-steve-soul-caper/#lead-singer-disease * * * It was on one of those drives where Stefon learned about copyright termination. It was 2011, and NPR was doing a story on the 1976 Copyright Act, passed the same year that was on the bottom of the document Chuy forged. Under the ’76 act, artists acquired a “termination right”—­ that is, the power to cancel any copyright assignment after thirty-­five years, even if they signed a contract promising to sign away their rights forever and a day (or until the copyright ran out, which was nearly the same thing). Listening to a smart, assured lady law professor from UC Berkeley explaining how this termination thing worked, Stefon got a wild idea. He pulled over and found a stub of a pencil and the back of a parking-­ticket envelope and wrote down the professor’s name when it was repeated at the end of the program. The next day he went to the Inglewood Public Library and got a reference librarian to teach him how to look up a UC Berkeley email address and he sent an email to the professor asking how he could terminate his copyright assignment. He was pretty sure she wasn’t going to answer him, but she did, in less than a day. He got the email on his son’s smartphone and the boy helped him send a reply asking if he could call her. One thing led to another and two weeks later, he’d filed the paperwork with the U.S. Copyright Office, along with a check for one hundred dollars. Time passed, and Stefon mostly forgot about his paperwork adventure with the Copyright Office, though every now and again he’d remember, think about that hundred dollars, and shake his head. Then, nearly a year later, there it was, in his mailbox: a letter saying that his copyright assignment had been canceled and his copyrights were his again. There was also a copy of a letter that had been sent to Chuy, explaining the same thing. Stefon knew a lawyer—­well, almost a lawyer, an ex–­trumpet player who became a paralegal after one time subbing for Sly Stone’s usual guy, and then never getting another gig that good. He invited Jamal over for dinner and cooked his best pot roast and served it with good whiskey and then Jamal agreed to send a letter to Inglewood Jams, informing them that Chuy no longer controlled his copyrights and they had to deal with him direct from now on. Stefon hand-­delivered the letter the next day, wearing his good suit for reasons he couldn’t explain. The receptionist took it without a blink. He waited. “Thank you,” she said, pointedly, glancing at the door. “I can wait,” he said. “For what?” She reminded him of his boy’s girlfriend, a sophomore a year younger than him. Both women projected a fierce message that they were done with everyone’s shit, especially shit from men, especially old men. He chose his words carefully. “I don’t know, honestly.” He smiled shyly. He was a good-­looking man, still. That smile had once beamed out of televisions all over America, from the Soul Train stage. “But ma’am, begging your pardon, that letter is about my music, which you all sell here. You sell a lot of it, and I want to talk that over with whoever is in charge of that business.” She let down her guard by one minute increment. “You’ll want Mr. Gounder,” she said. “He’s not in today. Give me your phone number, I’ll have him call.” He did, but Mr. Gounder didn’t call. He called back two days later, and the day after that, and the following Monday, and then he went back to the office. The receptionist who reminded him of his son’s girlfriend gave him a shocked look. “Hello,” he said, and tried out that shy smile. “I wonder if I might see that Mr. Gounder.” She grew visibly uncomfortable. “Mr. Gounder isn’t in today,” she lied. “I see,” he said. “Will he be in tomorrow?” “No,” she said. “The day after?” “No.” Softer. “Is that Mr. Gounder of yours ever coming in?” She sighed. “Mr. Gounder doesn’t want to speak with you, I’m sorry.” The smile hadn’t worked, so he switched to the look he used to give his bandmates when they wouldn’t cooperate. “Maybe someone can tell me why?” A door behind her had been open a crack; now it swung wide and a young man came out. He looked Hispanic, with a sharp fade and flashy sneakers, but he didn’t talk like a club kid or a hood rat—­he sounded like a USC law student. “Sir, if you have a claim you’d like Mr. Gounder to engage with, please have your attorney contact him directly.” Stefon looked this kid up and down and up, tried and failed to catch the receptionist’s eye, and said, “Maybe I can talk this over with you. Are you someone in charge around here?” “I’m Xavier Perez. I’m vice president for catalog development here. I don’t deal with legal claims, though. That’s strictly Mr. Gounder’s job. Please have your attorney put your query in writing and Mr. Gounder will be in touch as soon as is ­feasible.” “I did have a lawyer write him a letter,” Stefon said. “I gave it to this young woman. Mr. Gounder hasn’t been in touch.” Perez looked at the receptionist. “Did you receive a letter from this gentleman?” She nodded, still not meeting Stefon’s eye. “I gave it to Mr. Gounder last week.” Perez grinned, showing a gold tooth, and then, in his white, white voice, said, “There you have it. I’m sure Mr. Gounder will get back in touch with your counsel soon. Thank you for coming in today, Mr.—­” “Stefon Magner.” Stefon waited a moment, then said, for the first time in many years, “I used to perform under Steve Soul, though.” Perez nodded briskly. He’d known that. “Nice to meet you, Mr. Magner.” Without waiting for a reply, he disappeared back into his office.

<h1>Middlemen without enshittification (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/19/crad-kilodney-was-an-outlier/#intermediation">permalink</a>)</h1>
<p>Enshittification describes how platforms go bad, which is also how the internet goes bad, because the internet is made of platforms, which is weird, because platforms are intermediaries and we were promised that the internet would <em>disintermediate</em> the world:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel">https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel</a></p>
<p>The internet <em>did</em> disintermediate a hell of a lot of intermediaries &#8211; that is, "middlemen" &#8211; but then it created a bunch more of these middlemen, who coalesced into a handful of gatekeepers, or as the EU calls them "VLOPs" (Very Large Online Platforms, the most EU acronym ever).</p>
<p>Which raises two questions: first, why did so many of us end up flocking to these intermediaries' sites, and how did those sites end up with so much power?</p>
<p>To answer the first question, I want you to consider one of my favorite authors: Crad Kilodney (RIP):</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/thecradkilodneypapers">https://archive.org/details/thecradkilodneypapers</a></p>
<p>When I was growing up, Crad was a fixture on the streets of Toronto. All through the day and late into the evening, winter or summer, Crad would stand on the street with a sign around his neck ("Very famous Canadian author, buy my books, $2" or sometimes just "Margaret Atwood, buy my books, $2"). He wrote these deeply weird, often very funny short stories, which he edited, typeset, printed, bound and sold himself, one at a time, to people who approached him on the street.</p>
<p>I had a lot of conversations with Crad &#8211; as an aspiring writer, I was endlessly fascinated by him <em>and</em> his books. He was funny, acerbic &#8211; and sneaky. Crad wore a wire: he kept a hidden tape recorder rolling in his coat and he secretly recorded conversations with people like me, and then released a series of home-duplicated tapes of the weirdest and funniest ones:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/on-the-street-crad-kilodney-vol-1">https://archive.org/details/on-the-street-crad-kilodney-vol-1</a></p>
<p>I love Crad. He deserves more recognition. There's an on-again/off-again documentary about his life and work that I hope gets made some day:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/09/free-sample/#putrid-scum">https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/09/free-sample/#putrid-scum</a></p>
<p>But &#8211; and this is the crucial part &#8211; there are writers out there I want to hear from who couldn't do what Crad did. Maybe they can write books, but not edit them. Or edit them, but not typeset them. Or typeset, but not print. Or print, but not spend the rest of their lives standing on a street-corner with a "PUTRID SCUM" sign around their neck.</p>
<p>Which is fine. That's why we have intermediaries. I like booksellers (I was one!). I like publishers. I like distributors. I like their salesforce, who go forth and convince the booksellers of the world to stock books like mine. I have ten million things I want to do before I die, and I'm already 52, and being a sales-rep for a publisher isn't on my bucket list. I am <em>so</em> thankful that someone else wants to do this for me.</p>
<p><em>That's</em> why we have intermediaries, and why disintermediation always leads to some degree of re-intermediation. There's a lot of explicit and implicit knowledge and specialized skill required to connect buyers and sellers, creators and audiences, and other sides of two-sided markets. Some producers can do some of this stuff for themselves, and a very few &#8211; like Crad &#8211; can do it all, but most of us need some help, somewhere along the way. In the excellent 2022 book <em>Direct</em>, Kathryn Judge lays out a clear case for all the good that middlemen <em>can</em> do:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/12/direct-the-problem-of-middlemen/">https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/12/direct-the-problem-of-middlemen/</a></p>
<p>So why were we all so anxious for disintermediation back in the late 1990s? Here's a hint: it wasn't because we hated intermediaries &#8211; it was because we hated <em>powerful</em> intermediaries.</p>
<p>The point of an intermediary is to serve as a conduit between producers and consumers, buyers and sellers, audiences and creators. When an intermediary gains power over the audience &#8211; say, by locking them inside a walled garden &#8211; and then uses that lock-in to screw producers and appropriate an ever larger share of the value going between them, <em>that's</em> when intermediaries become a problem.</p>
<p>The problem isn't that someone will handle ticketing for your gig. The problem is that Ticketmaster has locked down <em>all</em> the ticketing, <em>and</em> the venues, <em>and</em> the promotions, and it uses that power to gouge fans and rip off artists:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/20/anything-that-cant-go-on-forever-will-eventually-stop/">https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/20/anything-that-cant-go-on-forever-will-eventually-stop/</a></p>
<p>The problem isn't that there's a well-made website that lets you shop for goods sold by many small merchants and producers. It's that Amazon has cornered this market, takes $0.51 out of every dollar you spend there, and clones and destroys any small merchant who succeeds on the platform:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/25/greedflation/#commissar-bezos">https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/25/greedflation/#commissar-bezos</a></p>
<p>The problem isn't that there's a website where you can stream most of the music ever recorded. It's that Spotify colludes with the Big Three labels to rip off artists and sneaks crap you don't want to hear into your stream in order to collect payola:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/12/streaming-doesnt-pay/#stunt-publishing">https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/12/streaming-doesnt-pay/#stunt-publishing</a></p>
<p>The problem isn't that there's a website where you can buy any audiobook you want. It's that Amazon's Audible locks every book to its platform forever and steals hundreds of millions of dollars from creators:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/25/can-you-hear-me-now/#acx-ripoff">https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/25/can-you-hear-me-now/#acx-ripoff</a></p>
<p>The problem, in other words, isn't intermediation &#8211; it's <em>power</em>. The thing that distinguishes a useful intermediary from an enshittified bully is <em>power</em>. Intermediaries gain power when our governments stop enforcing competition law. This lets intermediaries buy each other up and corner markets. Once they've formed cozy cartels, they can capture their regulators and commit rampant labor, privacy and consumer violations with impunity. That capture <em>also</em> lets them harness governments to punish smaller players that want to free workers, creators, audiences and customers from walled gardens. It also hands them a whip-hand over their workers, so that any worker who refuses to aid in these nefarious plans can be easily fired:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel">https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel</a></p>
<p>A world with intermediaries is a better world. As much as I love Crad Kilodney's books, I wouldn't want to live in a world where the only books on my shelves came from people prepared to stand on a street-corner wearing a "FOUL PUS FROM DEAD DOGS" sign.</p>
<p>The problem isn't intermediaries &#8211; it's <em>powerful</em> intermediaries. That's why the world's surging antitrust movement is so exciting: by reinstating competition law, we can keep intermediaries small and comparatively weak, so that creators and audiences, drivers and riders, sellers and buyers, and other groups seeking to connect will not find themselves made subservient to middlemen.</p>

<h1>The Bezzle excerpt (Part II) (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/19/crad-kilodney-was-an-outlier/#copyright-termination">permalink</a>)</h1>
<p>Today, I'm bringing you part two of this week's serialized excerpt from <em>The Bezzle</em>, my new Martin Hench high-tech crime revenge thriller:</p>
<p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle</a></p>
<p>Though most of the scams that Hench &#8211; a two-fisted forensic accountant specializing in Silicon Valley skullduggery &#8211; goes after in <em>The Bezzle</em> have a strong tech component, this excerpt concerns a pre-digital scam: music royalty theft.</p>
<p>This is a subject that I got really deep into when researching and writing 2022's <em>Chokepoint Capitalism</em> &#8211; a manifesto for fixing creative labor markets:</p>

<p>My co-author on that book is Rebecca Giblin, who also happens to be one of the world's leading experts in "copyright termination" &#8211; the legal right of creative workers to claw back any rights they signed over after 35 years:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/26/take-it-back/">https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/26/take-it-back/</a></p>
<p>This was enshrined in the 1976 Copyright Act, and has largely languished in obscurity since then, though recent years have seen creators of all kinds getting their rights back through termination &#8211; the authors of The Babysitters Club and Sweet Valley High Books, Stephen King, and George Clinton, to name a few. The estates of the core team at Marvel Comics, including Stan Lee, just settled a case that might have let them take the rights to all those characters back from Disney:</p>

<p>Copyright termination is a powerful tonic to the bargaining disparities between creative workers. A creative worker who signs a bad contract at the start of their career can &#8211; if they choose &#8211; tear that contract up 35 years later and demand a better one.</p>
<p>Turning this into a plot-point in <em>The Bezzle</em> is the kind of thing that I <em>love</em> about this series &#8211; the ability to take important, obscure, technical aspects of how the world works and turn them into high-stakes technothriller storylines that bring them to the audience they deserve.</p>
<p>If you signed something away 35 years ago and you want to get it back, try Rights Back, an automated termination of tranfer tool co-developed by Creative Commons and Authors Alliance (whose advisory board I volunteer on):</p>

<p>All right, onto today's installment. Here's part one, published on Saturday:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/17/the-steve-soul-caper/#lead-singer-disease">https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/17/the-steve-soul-caper/#lead-singer-disease</a></p>

It was on one of those drives where Stefon learned about copyright termination. It was 2011, and NPR was doing a story on the 1976 Copyright Act, passed the same year that was on the bottom of the document Chuy forged.</p>
<p>Under the ’76 act, artists acquired a “termination right”—­ that is, the power to cancel any copyright assignment after thirty-­five years, even if they signed a contract promising to sign away their rights forever and a day (or until the copyright ran out, which was nearly the same thing).</p>
<p>Listening to a smart, assured lady law professor from UC Berkeley explaining how this termination thing worked, Stefon got a wild idea. He pulled over and found a stub of a pencil and the back of a parking-­ticket envelope and wrote down the professor’s name when it was repeated at the end of the program. The next day he went to the Inglewood Public Library and got a reference librarian to teach him how to look up a UC Berkeley email address and he sent an email to the professor asking how he could terminate his copyright assignment.</p>
<p>He was pretty sure she wasn’t going to answer him, but she did, in less than a day. He got the email on his son’s smartphone and the boy helped him send a reply asking if he could call her. One thing led to another and two weeks later, he’d filed the paperwork with the U.S. Copyright Office, along with a check for one hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Time passed, and Stefon mostly forgot about his paperwork adventure with the Copyright Office, though every now and again he’d remember, think about that hundred dollars, and shake his head. Then, nearly a year later, there it was, in his mailbox: a letter saying that his copyright assignment had been canceled and his copyrights were his again. There was also a copy of a letter that had been sent to Chuy, explaining the same thing.</p>
<p>Stefon knew a lawyer—­well, almost a lawyer, an ex–­trumpet player who became a paralegal after one time subbing for Sly Stone’s usual guy, and then never getting another gig that good. He invited Jamal over for dinner and cooked his best pot roast and served it with good whiskey and then Jamal agreed to send a letter to Inglewood Jams, informing them that Chuy no longer controlled his copyrights and they had to deal with him direct from now on.</p>
<p>Stefon hand-­delivered the letter the next day, wearing his good suit for reasons he couldn’t explain. The receptionist took it without a blink. He waited.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said, pointedly, glancing at the door.</p>
<p>“I can wait,” he said.</p>
<p>“For <em>what</em>?” She reminded him of his boy’s girlfriend, a sophomore a year younger than him. Both women projected a fierce message that they were done with everyone’s shit, especially shit from men, especially old men. He chose his words carefully.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, honestly.” He smiled shyly. He was a good-­looking man, still. That smile had once beamed out of televisions all over America, from the <em>Soul Train</em> stage. “But ma’am, begging your pardon, that letter is about my music, which you all sell here. You sell a lot of it, and I want to talk that over with whoever is in charge of that business.”</p>
<p>She let down her guard by one minute increment. “You’ll want Mr. Gounder,” she said. “He’s not in today. Give me your phone number, I’ll have him call.”</p>
<p>He did, but Mr. Gounder didn’t call. He called back two days later, and the day after that, and the following Monday, and then he went back to the office. The receptionist who reminded him of his son’s girlfriend gave him a shocked look.</p>
<p>“Hello,” he said, and tried out that shy smile. “I wonder if I might see that Mr. Gounder.”</p>
<p>She grew visibly uncomfortable. “Mr. Gounder isn’t in today,” she lied. “I see,” he said. “Will he be in tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“No,” she said.</p>
<p>“The day after?”</p>
<p>“No.” Softer.</p>
<p>“Is that Mr. Gounder of yours ever coming in?”</p>
<p>She sighed. “Mr. Gounder doesn’t want to speak with you, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>The smile hadn’t worked, so he switched to the look he used to give his bandmates when they wouldn’t cooperate. “Maybe someone can tell me why?”</p>
<p>A door behind her had been open a crack; now it swung wide and a young man came out. He looked Hispanic, with a sharp fade and flashy sneakers, but he didn’t talk like a club kid or a hood rat—­he sounded like a USC law student.</p>
<p>“Sir, if you have a claim you’d like Mr. Gounder to engage with, please have your attorney contact him directly.”</p>
<p>Stefon looked this kid up and down and up, tried and failed to catch the receptionist’s eye, and said, “Maybe I can talk this over with you. Are you someone in charge around here?”</p>
<p>“I’m Xavier Perez. I’m vice president for catalog development here. I don’t deal with legal claims, though. That’s strictly Mr. Gounder’s job. Please have your attorney put your query in writing and Mr. Gounder will be in touch as soon as is ­feasible.”</p>
<p>“I did have a lawyer write him a letter,” Stefon said. “I gave it to this young woman. Mr. Gounder hasn’t been in touch.”</p>
<p>Perez looked at the receptionist. “Did you receive a letter from this gentleman?”</p>
<p>She nodded, still not meeting Stefon’s eye. “I gave it to Mr. Gounder last week.”</p>
<p>Perez grinned, showing a gold tooth, and then, in his white, white voice, said, “There you have it. I’m sure Mr. Gounder will get back in touch with your counsel soon. Thank you for coming in today, Mr.—­”</p>
<p>“Stefon Magner.” Stefon waited a moment, then said, for the first time in many years, “I used to perform under Steve Soul, though.”</p>
<p>Perez nodded briskly. He’d known that. “Nice to meet you, Mr. Magner.” Without waiting for a reply, he disappeared back into his office.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links An excerpt from The Bezzle: A George Clinton/Leonard Cohen-inspired royalty-theft caper. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading An excerpt from The Bezzle (permalink) Today, I'm bringing you part one of an excerpt from Chapter 14 of The Bezzle, my next novel, which drops on Feb 20. It's an ice-cold revenge technothriller starring Martin Hench, a two-fisted forensic accountant specialized in high-tech fraud: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle Hench is the Zelig of high-tech fraud, a character who's spent 40 years in Silicon Valley unwinding every tortured scheme hatched by tech-bros who view the spreadsheet as a teleporter that whisks other peoples' money into their own bank-accounts. This setup is allowing me to write a whole string of these books, each of which unwinds a different scam from tech's past, present and future, starting with last year's Red Team Blues (now in paperback!), a novel that whose high-intensity thriller plotline is also a masterclass in why cryptocurrency is a scam: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865854/redteamblues Turning financial scams into entertainment is important work. Finance's most devastating defense is the Shield Of Boringness (h/t Dana Clare) &#8211; tactically deployed complexity designed to induce the state that finance bros call "MEGO" ("my eyes glaze over"). By combining jargon and obfuscation, the most monstrous criminals of our age have been able to repeatedly bring our civilization to the brink of collapse (remember 2008?) and then spin their way out of it. Turning these schemes into entertainment is hard, necessary work, because it incinerates the respectable suit and tie and leaves the naked dishonesty of the finance sector on display for all to see. In The Big Short, they recruited Margot Robbie to explain synthetic CDOs from a bubble-bath. And John Oliver does this every week on Last Week Tonight, coming up with endlessly imaginative stunts and gags to flense the bullshit, laying the scam economy open to the bone. This was my inspiration for the Hench novels (I've written and sold three of these, of which The Bezzle is number two; I've got at least two more planned). Could I use the same narrative tactics I used to explain mass surveillance, cryptography and infosec in the Little Brother books to turn scams into entertainment, and entertainment into the necessary, informed outrage that might precipitate change? The main storyline in The Bezzle concerns one of the most gruesome scams in today's America: prison-tech, which sees America's vast army of prisoners being stripped of letters, calls, in-person visits, parcels, libraries and continuing ed in favor of cheap tablets that bilk prisoners and their families of eye-watering sums for every click they make: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/14/minnesota-nice/#shitty-technology-adoption-curve But each Hench novel has a variety of side-quests that work to expose different kinds of financial chicanery. The Bezzle also contains explainers on the workings of MLMs/Ponzis (and how Gerry Ford and Betsy DeVos's father-in-law legalized one of the most destructive forces in America) and the way that oligarchs, foreign and domestic, use Real Estate Investment Trusts to hide their money and destroy our cities. And there's a subplot about music-royalty theft, a form of pernicious wage theft that is present up and down the music industry supply-chain. This is a subject that came up a lot when Rebecca Giblin and I were researching and writing Chokepoint Capitalism, our 2022 book about creative labor markets: https://chokepointcapitalism.com/ Two of the standout cases from that research formed the nucleus of the subplot in The Bezzle, the case of Leonard Cohen's batshit manager who stole millions from him and then went to prison for stalking him, leaving him virtually penniless and forced to keep touring to keep himself fed: https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/19/leonard-cohen-former-manager-jailed The other was George Clinton, whose manager forged his signature on a royalty assignment, then used the stolen money to defend himself against Clinton's attempts to wrestle his rights back and even to sue Clinton for defamation for writing about the caper in his memoir: https://www.musicconnection.com/the-legal-beat-george-clinton-wins-defamation-case/ That's the tale that this excerpt &#8211; which I'll be serializing in six parts over the coming week &#8211; tells, in fictionalized form. It's not Margot Robbie in a bubble-bath, it's not a John Oliver monologue, but I think it's pretty goddamned good. I'm leaving for a long, multi-city, multi-country, multi-continent tour with The Bezzle next Wednesday, starting with an event at Weller Bookworks in Salt Lake City on the 21st: https://www.wellerbookworks.com/event/store-cory-doctorow-feb-21-630-pm I'll in be in San Diego on the 22nd at Mysterious Galaxy: https://www.mystgalaxy.com/22224Doctorow And then it's on to LA (with Adam Conover), Seattle (with Neal Stephenson), Portland, Phoenix and beyond: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/16/narrative-capitalism/#bezzle-tour I hope you'll come out for the tour (and bring your friends)! * * * Between 1972 and 1978, Steve Soul (a.k.a. Stefon Magner) had a string of sixteen Billboard Hot 100 singles, one of which cracked the Top 10 and won him an appearance on Soul Train. He is largely forgotten today, except by hip-­hop producers who prize his tracks as a source of deep, funky grooves. They sampled the hell out of him, not least because his rights were controlled by Inglewood Jams, a clearinghouse for obscure funk tracks that charged less than half of what the Big Three labels extracted for each sample license. Even at that lower rate, those license payments would have set Stefon up for a comfortable retirement, especially when added to his Social Security and the disability check from Dodgers Stadium, where he cleaned floors for more than a decade before he fell down a beer-­slicked bleacher and cracked two of his lumbar discs. But Stefon didn’t get a dime. His former manager, Chuy Flores, forged his signature on a copyright assignment in 1976. Stefon didn’t discover this fact until 1979, because Chuy kept cutting him royalty checks, even as Stefon’s band broke up and those royalties trickled off. In Stefon’s telling, the band broke up because the rest of the act—­especially the three-­piece rhythm section of two percussionists and a beautiful bass player with a natural afro and a wild, infectious hip-­wiggle while she played—­were too coked up to make it to rehearsal, making their performances into shambling wreckages and their studio sessions into vicious bickerfests. To hear the band tell of it, Stefon had bad LSD (“Lead Singer Disease”) and decided he didn’t need the rest of them. One thing they all agreed on: there was no way Stefon would have signed over the band’s earnings to Chuy, who was little more than a glorified bookkeeper, with Stefon hustling all their bookings and even ordering taxis to his bandmates’ houses to make sure they showed up at the studio or the club on time. Stefon remembered October of ’79 well. He’d been waiting with dread for the envelope from Chuy. The previous royalty check, in July, had been under $250. The previous quarter’s had been over $1,000. This quarter’s might have zero. Stefon needed the money. His 1972 Ford Galaxie needed a new transmission. He couldn’t keep driving it in first. The envelope arrived late, the day before Halloween, and for a brief moment, Stefon was overcome by an incredible, unbelieving elation: Chuy’s laboriously typewritten royalty statement ended with the miraculous figure of $7,421.16. Seven thousand dollars! It was more than two years’ royalties, all in one go! He could fix the Galaxie’s transmission and get the ragtop patched, and still have money left over for his back rent, his bar tab, his child support, and a fine steak dinner, and even then, he’d end the month with money in his savings account. But there was no check in the envelope. Stefon shook the envelope, carefully unfolded the royalty statement to ensure that there was no check stapled to its back, went downstairs to the apartment building lobby and rechecked his mailbox. Finally, he called Chuy. “Chuy, man, you forgot to put a check in the envelope.” “I didn’t forget, Steve. Read the paperwork again. You gotta send me a check.” “What the fuck? That’s not funny, Chuy.” “I ain’t joking, Steve. I been advancing you royalties for more than three years, but you haven’t earned nothing new since then—­no new recordings. I can’t afford to carry you no more.” “Say what?” Chuy explained it to him like he was a toddler. “Remember when you signed over your royalties to me in ’76? Every dime I’ve sent you since then was an advance on your future recordings, only you haven’t had none of those, so I’m cutting you off and calling in your note. I’m sorry, Steve, but I ain’t a charity. You don’t work, you don’t earn. This is America, brother. No free lunches.” “After I did what in ’76?” “Steve, in 1976 you signed over all your royalties to me. We agreed, man! I can’t believe you don’t remember this! You came over to my spot and I told you how it was and you said you needed money to cover the extra horns for the studio session on Fight Fire with Water. I told you I’d cover them and you’d sign over all your royalties to me.” Stefon was briefly speechless. Chuy had paid the sidemen on that session, but that was because Chuy owed him a thousand bucks for a string of private parties they’d played for some of Chuy’s cronies. Chuy had been stiffing him for months and Stefon had agreed to swap the session fees for the horn players in exchange for wiping out the debt, which had been getting in the way of their professional relationship. “Chuy, you know it didn’t happen that way. What the fuck are you talking about?” “I’m talking about when you signed over all your royalties to me. And you know what? I don’t like your tone. I’ve carried your ass for years now, sent you all that money out of my own pocket, and now you gotta pay up. My generosity’s run out. When you gonna send me a check?” Of course, it was a gambit. It put Stefon on tilt, got him to say a lot of ill-­advised things over the phone, which Chuy secretly recorded. It also prompted Stefon to take a swing at Chuy, which Chuy dived on, shamming that he’d had a soft-­tissue injury in his neck, bringing suit for damages and pressing an aggravated-­assault charge. He dropped all that once Stefon agreed not to keep on with any claims about the forged signature; Stefon went on to become a good husband, a good father, and a hard worker. And if cleaning floors at Dodgers Stadium wasn’t what he’d dreamed of when he was headlining on Soul Train, at least he never missed a game, and his boy came most weekends and watched with him. Stefon’s supervisor didn’t care. But the stolen royalties ate at him, especially when he started hearing his licks every time he turned on the radio. His voice, even. Chuy Flores had a fully paid-­off three-­bedroom in Eagle Rock and two cars and two ex-­wives and three kids he was paying child support on, and Stefon sometimes drove past Chuy Flores’s house to look at his fancy palm trees all wrapped up in strings of Christmas lights and think about who paid for them.

<h1>An excerpt from The Bezzle (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/17/the-steve-soul-caper/#lead-singer-disease">permalink</a>)</h1>
<p>Today, I'm bringing you part one of an excerpt from Chapter 14 of <em>The Bezzle</em>, my next novel, which drops on Feb 20. It's an ice-cold revenge technothriller starring Martin Hench, a two-fisted forensic accountant specialized in high-tech fraud:</p>
<p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle</a></p>
<p>Hench is the Zelig of high-tech fraud, a character who's spent 40 years in Silicon Valley unwinding every tortured scheme hatched by tech-bros who view the spreadsheet as a teleporter that whisks other peoples' money into their own bank-accounts. This setup is allowing me to write a whole string of these books, each of which unwinds a different scam from tech's past, present and future, starting with last year's <em>Red Team Blues</em> (now in paperback!), a novel that whose high-intensity thriller plotline is also a masterclass in why cryptocurrency is a scam:</p>
<p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865854/redteamblues">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865854/redteamblues</a></p>
<p>Turning financial scams into entertainment is important work. Finance's most devastating defense is the Shield Of Boringness (h/t Dana Clare) &#8211; tactically deployed complexity designed to induce the state that finance bros call "MEGO" ("my eyes glaze over"). By combining jargon and obfuscation, the most monstrous criminals of our age have been able to repeatedly bring our civilization to the brink of collapse (remember 2008?) and then spin their way out of it.</p>
<p>Turning these schemes into entertainment is hard, necessary work, because it incinerates the respectable suit and tie and leaves the naked dishonesty of the finance sector on display for all to see. In <em>The Big Short</em>, they recruited Margot Robbie to explain synthetic CDOs from a bubble-bath. And John Oliver does this every week on <em>Last Week Tonight</em>, coming up with endlessly imaginative stunts and gags to flense the bullshit, laying the scam economy open to the bone.</p>
<p>This was my inspiration for the Hench novels (I've written and sold three of these, of which <em>The Bezzle</em> is number two; I've got at least two more planned). Could I use the same narrative tactics I used to explain mass surveillance, cryptography and infosec in the <em>Little Brother</em> books to turn scams into entertainment, and entertainment into the necessary, informed outrage that might precipitate change?</p>
<p>The main storyline in <em>The Bezzle</em> concerns one of the most gruesome scams in today's America: prison-tech, which sees America's vast army of prisoners being stripped of letters, calls, in-person visits, parcels, libraries and continuing ed in favor of cheap tablets that bilk prisoners and their families of eye-watering sums for every click they make:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/14/minnesota-nice/#shitty-technology-adoption-curve">https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/14/minnesota-nice/#shitty-technology-adoption-curve</a></p>
<p>But each Hench novel has a variety of side-quests that work to expose different kinds of financial chicanery. <em>The Bezzle</em> also contains explainers on the workings of MLMs/Ponzis (and how Gerry Ford and Betsy DeVos's father-in-law legalized one of the most destructive forces in America) and the way that oligarchs, foreign and domestic, use Real Estate Investment Trusts to hide their money and destroy our cities.</p>
<p><em>And</em> there's a subplot about music-royalty theft, a form of pernicious wage theft that is present up and down the music industry supply-chain. This is a subject that came up a lot when Rebecca Giblin and I were researching and writing <em>Chokepoint Capitalism</em>, our 2022 book about creative labor markets:</p>
<p><a href="https://chokepointcapitalism.com/">https://chokepointcapitalism.com/</a></p>
<p>Two of the standout cases from that research formed the nucleus of the subplot in <em>The Bezzle</em>, the case of Leonard Cohen's batshit manager who stole millions from him and then went to prison for stalking him, leaving him virtually penniless and forced to keep touring to keep himself fed:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/19/leonard-cohen-former-manager-jailed">https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/19/leonard-cohen-former-manager-jailed</a></p>
<p>The other was George Clinton, whose manager forged his signature on a royalty assignment, then used the stolen money to defend himself against Clinton's attempts to wrestle his rights back and even to sue Clinton for defamation for writing about the caper in his memoir:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.musicconnection.com/the-legal-beat-george-clinton-wins-defamation-case/">https://www.musicconnection.com/the-legal-beat-george-clinton-wins-defamation-case/</a></p>
<p>That's the tale that this excerpt &#8211; which I'll be serializing in six parts over the coming week &#8211; tells, in fictionalized form. It's not Margot Robbie in a bubble-bath, it's not a John Oliver monologue, but I think it's pretty goddamned good.</p>
<p>I'm leaving for a long, multi-city, multi-country, multi-continent tour with <em>The Bezzle</em> next Wednesday, starting with an event at Weller Bookworks in Salt Lake City on the 21st:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wellerbookworks.com/event/store-cory-doctorow-feb-21-630-pm">https://www.wellerbookworks.com/event/store-cory-doctorow-feb-21-630-pm</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mystgalaxy.com/22224Doctorow">https://www.mystgalaxy.com/22224Doctorow</a></p>
<p>And then it's on to LA (with Adam Conover), Seattle (with Neal Stephenson), Portland, Phoenix and beyond:</p>

<p>I hope you'll come out for the tour (and bring your friends)!</p>
<p><center> * * * </center></p>
<p>Between 1972 and 1978, Steve Soul (a.k.a. Stefon Magner) had a string of sixteen <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 singles, one of which cracked the Top 10 and won him an appearance on <em>Soul Train</em>. He is largely forgotten today, except by hip-­hop producers who prize his tracks as a source of deep, funky grooves. They sampled the hell out of him, not least because his rights were controlled by Inglewood Jams, a clearinghouse for obscure funk tracks that charged less than half of what the Big Three labels extracted for each sample license.</p>
<p>Even at that lower rate, those license payments would have set Stefon up for a comfortable retirement, especially when added to his Social Security and the disability check from Dodgers Stadium, where he cleaned floors for more than a decade before he fell down a beer-­slicked bleacher and cracked two of his lumbar discs. But Stefon didn’t get a dime. His former manager, Chuy Flores, forged his signature on a copyright assignment in 1976. Stefon didn’t discover this fact until 1979, because Chuy kept cutting him royalty checks, even as Stefon’s band broke up and those royalties trickled off. In Stefon’s telling, the band broke up because the rest of the act—­especially the three-­piece rhythm section of two percussionists and a beautiful bass player with a natural afro and a wild, infectious hip-­wiggle while she played—­were too coked up to make it to rehearsal, making their performances into shambling wreckages and their studio sessions into vicious bickerfests. To hear the band tell of it, Stefon had bad LSD (“Lead Singer Disease”) and decided he didn’t need the rest of them. One thing they all agreed on: there was no way Stefon would have signed over the band’s earnings to Chuy, who was little more than a glorified bookkeeper, with Stefon hustling all their bookings and even ordering taxis to his bandmates’ houses to make sure they showed up at the studio or the club on time. Stefon remembered October of ’79 well. He’d been waiting with dread for the envelope from Chuy. The previous royalty check, in July, had been under $250. The previous quarter’s had been over $1,000. This quarter’s might have zero. Stefon needed the money. His 1972 Ford Galaxie needed a new transmission. He couldn’t keep driving it in first.</p>
<p>The envelope arrived late, the day before Halloween, and for a brief moment, Stefon was overcome by an incredible, unbelieving elation: Chuy’s laboriously typewritten royalty statement ended with the miraculous figure of $7,421.16. Seven thousand dollars! It was more than two years’ royalties, all in one go! He could fix the Galaxie’s transmission and get the ragtop patched, and still have money left over for his back rent, his bar tab, his child support, <em>and</em> a fine steak dinner, and even then, he’d end the month with money in his savings account.</p>
<p>But there was no check in the envelope. Stefon shook the envelope, carefully unfolded the royalty statement to ensure that there was no check stapled to its back, went downstairs to the apartment building lobby and rechecked his mailbox.</p>
<p>Finally, he called Chuy.</p>
<p>“Chuy, man, you forgot to put a check in the envelope.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t forget, Steve. Read the paperwork again. You gotta send <em>me</em> a check.”</p>
<p>“What the <em>fuck</em>? That’s not funny, Chuy.”</p>
<p>“I ain’t joking, Steve. I been advancing you royalties for more than three years, but you haven’t earned nothing new since then—­no new recordings. I can’t afford to carry you no more.”</p>
<p>“Say what?”</p>
<p>Chuy explained it to him like he was a toddler. “Remember when you signed over your royalties to me in ’76? Every dime I’ve sent you since then was an advance on your <em>future</em> recordings, only you haven’t had none of those, so I’m cutting you off and calling in your note. I’m sorry, Steve, but I ain’t a charity. You don’t work, you don’t earn. This is America, brother. No free lunches.”</p>
<p>“After I did what in ’76?”</p>
<p>“Steve, in 1976 you signed over all your royalties to me. We agreed, man! I can’t believe you don’t remember this! You came over to my spot and I told you how it was and you said you needed money to cover the extra horns for the studio session on <em>Fight Fire with Water</em>. I told you I’d cover them and you’d sign over all your royalties to me.”</p>
<p>Stefon was briefly speechless. Chuy <em>had</em> paid the sidemen on that session, but that was because Chuy owed <em>him</em> a thousand bucks for a string of private parties they’d played for some of Chuy’s cronies. Chuy had been stiffing him for months and Stefon had agreed to swap the session fees for the horn players in exchange for wiping out the debt, which had been getting in the way of their professional relationship.</p>
<p>“Chuy, you know it didn’t happen that way. What the fuck are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“I’m talking about when you signed over all your royalties to me. And you know what? I don’t like your tone. I’ve carried your ass for years now, sent you all that money out of my own pocket, and now you gotta pay up. My generosity’s run out. When you gonna send me a check?”</p>
<p>Of course, it was a gambit. It put Stefon on tilt, got him to say a lot of ill-­advised things over the phone, which Chuy secretly recorded. It also prompted Stefon to take a swing at Chuy, which Chuy dived on, shamming that he’d had a soft-­tissue injury in his neck, bringing suit for damages and pressing an aggravated-­assault charge.</p>
<p>He dropped all that once Stefon agreed not to keep on with any claims about the forged signature; Stefon went on to become a good husband, a good father, and a hard worker. And if cleaning floors at Dodgers Stadium wasn’t what he’d dreamed of when he was headlining on <em>Soul Train</em>, at least he never missed a game, and his boy came most weekends and watched with him. Stefon’s supervisor didn’t care.</p>
<p>But the stolen royalties ate at him, especially when he started hearing <em>his</em> licks every time he turned on the radio. His <em>voice</em>, even. Chuy Flores had a fully paid-­off three-­bedroom in Eagle Rock and two cars and two ex-­wives and three kids he was paying child support on, and Stefon sometimes drove past Chuy Flores’s house to look at his fancy palm trees all wrapped up in strings of Christmas lights and think about who paid for them.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links How America's oligarchs lull us with the be-your-own-boss fairy tale: Temporarily embarrassed millionaires aren't born, they're made. Come see me on tour!: LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver, Calgary, Phoenix, Portland, Providence, Boston, New York City, Toronto, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Tucson, Chicago, Amherst, Torino, Tartu. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading How America's oligarchs lull us with the be-your-own-boss fairy tale (permalink) Capitalism is a vibes-based system. Sure, we all know about Keynes's "Animal Spirits" that see "bulls" and "bears" vying to set the market's future, but beyond that, there's just a hell of a lot of narrative. Writing for The American Prospect, Adam M Lowenstein reviews two books that tell the histories of the stories that are used to sell American capitalism to the American people &#8211; the stories that turn workers into "temporarily embarrassed millionaires": https://prospect.org/culture/books/2024-02-16-stories-corporations-tell-williams-waterhouse-review/ The first of these books is Taming the Octopus: The Long Battle for the Soul of the Corporation, by Kyle Edward Williams, a kind of pre-history of "woke capitalism": https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393867237 Taming is a history of the low-water marks for Big Business's reputation in America, and how each was overcome through PR campaigns that declared a turning point in which business leaders would pursue the common good, even at the expense of their shareholders' interests. The story starts in the 1950s, when DuPont and other massive firms had gained a well-deserved reputation as rapacious profit-generation machines that "alienated workers and pushed around small businessmen, investors, and consumers." This prompted DuPont's PR chief, Harold Brayman, to write a memo called "The Attack on Bigness," where he set out a plan to sell America on a new cuddly image for corporate giants. For Brayman, the problem was that corporate execs were too shy about telling their social inferiors about all the good that businesses did for them: "The businessman is normally reluctant to talk out loud. He frequently shuns the spotlight and is content with plugging his wares, not himself." This was the starting gun for a charm offensive by American big business that included IBM president Thomas Watson Jr ("I think there is a world market for about five computers") going on a speaking tour organized by McKinsey &#38; Co, where he told audiences that his company's billion dollar annual profits had convinced it to assume "responsibilities for the broader public welfare." This set the template for a nationwide mania of "business statesmanship" that Fortune celebrated with an editorial announcing "a great transformation, of which the world as a whole is as yet unaware" that put the "profit motive&#8230;on its last leg." Fortune then spent the next seventy years recycling this announcement, every time the tide went out on business's popularity. In 2019, Fortune platformed IBM president Ginni Rometty for an announcement that the company was orienting its priorities to the public good: "It’s a question of whether society trusts you or not. We need society to accept what it is that we do." The occasion for Rometty's quote was a special package on the Trump tax-cuts, a trillion-dollar gift to American big business, which lobbyists for the Business Roundtable celebrated with an announcement that American capitalism would now serve "stakeholders" (not just shareholders). Fortune celebrated this "change" as "fundamental and profound." Fast forward five years and corporate leaders are still telling stories, this time about "stakeholder capitalism" and "ESG" &#8211; the dread "woke capitalism" that has right-wing swivel-eyed loons running around, hair afire, declaring the end of capitalism. For Williams and Lowenstein (and me), all this ESG, DEI, and responsible capitalism is just window dressing, a distraction to keep the pitchforks and torches in people's closets, and to keep the guillotines in their packaging. The right-wing is doing a mirror-world version of liberals who freak out when OpenAI claims to have built a machine that will pauperize every worker &#8211; assuming that a PR pitch is the gospel truth, and then repeating it in criticism. Criti-hype, in other words: https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5 Think of ESG: the right is freaking out that ESG is harming shareholders by leaving hydrocarbons in the ground to appease climate-addled greenies. The reality is that ESG is barely disguised greenwashing, and it's fully compatible with burning every critter that died in the Mesozoic, Cenozoic, and lo, even the Paleozoic: https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/15/sanctions-financing/#profiteers The reason this tactic is so successful is that Americans have also been sold another narrative: that American problems are solved by American individuals as entrepreneurs and businesspeople, not as polities or as members of a union (let alone the working class!). This is the subject of the second book Lowenstein reviews, One Day I’ll Work for Myself: The Dream and Delusion That Conquered America, by Benjamin Waterhouse: https://wwnorton.com/books/one-day-ill-work-for-myself/ A keystone of American narrative capitalism is the idea that the USA is a nation of small businesspeople, Jeffersonian yeoman farmsteaders of the US economy. But even a cursory examination shows that the country is ruled &#8211; economically and politically &#8211; by very large firms. Uber sells itself as a way to be your own boss ("No shifts. No boss. No limits.") &#8211; even though it's a system where the app is your boss, and thanks to that layer of misdirection, Uber gets to be the worst conceivable boss, while its workers have no recourse in labor law: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men In labor fights, Uber represents itself as the champion of innumerable "small businesspeople" who drive its unlicensed taxis. In consumer protection fights, Amazon claims to be fighting for "small businesspeople" who sell on its platform. In privacy fights, Facebook claims to represent "small businesspeople" who buy its surveillance advertising. But large firms are actively hostile to small firms, seeing them as small-fry to be rooked or destroyed (recall that when Amazon targeted small publishers for bankruptcy-level discounts, they called the program "The Gazelle Project" and Bezos told his executives to tackle these firms "the way a cheetah pursues a sickly gazelle"). Decades of this tale have produced "a profound shift from a shared belief that individuals might come together to solve problems, into a collective faith in individual effort." America's long love-affair with rugged individualism was weaponized in the 1970s by corporations seeking to shed their regulatory obligation to workers, customers, and the environment. As with Big Tech today, the big business lobby held up mom-and-pop businesses as the true beneficiaries of deregulation, even as they knifed these firms. A telling anecdote comes from someone who worked for the Chamber of Commerce's magazine Nation's Business: when this editor pointed out that many of the magazine's subscribers were small businesspeople and asked if they could start including articles relevant to mom-and-pops, the editor in chief said, "Over my dead body." The neoliberal era has been an unbroken string of platitudes celebrating the small business and policies that annihilate their chances against large firms. Ronald Reagan's dewy-eyed hymns to American entrepreneurship sounded nice, but what matters is that he attempted to abolish the Small Business Administration and refused to address the 20,000 attendee "White House Conference on Small Business." In the years since, American has sacrificed its small businesses while pulling out all the stops &#8211; bailouts and tax cuts and elite bankruptcy &#8211; to keep its largest firms growing. New regulations like Dodd-Frank were neutered in the name of saving mom-and-pop shops, even though the provisions that were cut already exempted small businesses. Today, millions of Americans are treading water in a fetid stew of LLC-poisoning, rise-and-grind, multi-level-marketing, dropshipping and gig-work, convinced that the only way to get a better life is to pull themselves up by their bootstraps: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/10/declaration-of-interdependence/ Narrative does a lot of work here. The American economy runs on bubbles, another form of narrative capitalism. Take AI, a subject I sincerely wish I could stop hearing about, not least because I'm certain that 99% of that thinking is being wasted on whatever residue remains after the bubble pops: https://locusmag.com/2023/12/commentary-cory-doctorow-what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai/ AI isn't going to do your job, but its narrative may convince your boss to fire you and replace you with a bot that can't do your job. Like what happened when Air Canada hired a chatbot to answer customer inquiries and it started making shit up about bereavement discounts that the company later claimed it didn't have to honor: https://bc.ctvnews.ca/air-canada-s-chatbot-gave-a-b-c-man-the-wrong-information-now-the-airline-has-to-pay-for-the-mistake-1.6769454 This story's been all over the news for the past couple of days, but so far as I've seen, no one has pointed out the seemingly obvious inference that this chatbot probably ripped off lots of people. The victim here was extraordinarily persistent, chasing a refund for 10 weeks and then going to the regulator. This guy is a six-sigma self-advocate &#8211; which implies a whole bell-curve's worth of comparatively normal people who just ate the shit-sandwich Air Canada fed them. The reason AI is a winning proposition for Air Canada isn't that it can do a customer service rep's job &#8211; it can't. But the AI is a layer of indirection &#8211; like the app that is the true boss of Uber drivers &#8211; that lets Air Canada demoralize the customers it steals from into walking away from their losses. Nevertheless, the narrative that AI Will Change Everything Forever is powerful &#8211; more powerful than AI itself, that's for sure. Take this Bloomberg headline: "Nearly all wealth gained by world's rich this year comes from AI": https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/nearly-all-wealth-gained-by-world-s-rich-this-year-comes-from-ai-124021600006_1.html Dig in and you find even more narrative. The single largest beneficiary of AI stock gains last year was Mark Zuckerberg ($161B!). Zuck is American Narrative Capitalism's greatest practitioner: the guy who made billions peddling a series of lies, from "pivot to video" to "metaverse," leaping from one lie to the next just ahead of the mass stock-selloffs that wiped out lesser predators. The Narrative Capitalism Cinematic Universe has a lot of side-plots like AI and entrepreneurship and woke capitalism, but its main narrative arc was articulated, ad nauseum, by Margaret Thatcher: "There is no alternative." This is the most important part of the story, the part that says it literally can't be otherwise. The only way to organize society is through markets, and the only way to organize markets is to leave them alone, no matter how much suffering they cause. This is a baffling story, because it's so easily disproved. Zuck says the only way to have friends is to let him surveil you from asshole to appetite, even though he once ran Facebook as the privacy-forward alternative to MySpace, and promised never to spy on you: https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1128876 Likewise, the business leaders &#8211; and their chorus of dutiful Renfields &#8211; who insist that monopoly is the natural and inevitable outcome of any market economy just handwave away the decades during which anti-monopoly enforcement actually kept most businesses from getting too big to fail and too big to jail. I'm no champion of market efficiency &#8211; especially not as the best and final arbiter of social and economic questions &#8211; but when I hear my comrades repeating the Thatcherite claims that all forms of capitalism necessarily degrade into monopolistic quagmires, that there is no alternative, it sounds like more criti-hype. This is a frequent point of departure during discussions of enshittification: some people dismiss the whole idea of enshittification as "just capitalism." But we had decades of digital services that either didn't degrade, or, when they did, were replaced by superior competitors with a minimum of switching costs for users who migrated from the decaying incumbent to greener pastures. The reality is that while there are problems with all forms of capitalism, there are different kinds of capitalist problems, and some forms of capitalism are less harmful to working people and more capable of enacting and enforcing sound policy than others. Enshittification is what happens when the constraints on the worst impulses of companies and their investors and managers are removed. When a company doesn't have competitors, when it can capture its regulators to trample our rights with impunity, when it can enlist those regulators to shut down would-be competitors who might free us from its "walled garden," and when it can fire any worker who refuses to enact harm upon the users they serve, then that company will enshittify: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel A company can be made to treat you well, even if it is run by a wicked person who sees you as a mark to be fleeced &#8211; that mustache twirler just has to be constrained &#8211; by competition, regulation, self-help and labor. He may still hate you and wish you harm, but he won't be able to act on it. As MLK said: It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, religion and education will have to do that, but it can restrain him from lynching me. And I think that's pretty important also. And so that while legislation may not change the hearts of men, it does change the habits of men. And we see this every day. Come see me on tour!

<h1>How America's oligarchs lull us with the be-your-own-boss fairy tale (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/16/narrative-capitalism/#sell-job">permalink</a>)</h1>
<p>Capitalism is a vibes-based system. Sure, we all know about Keynes's "Animal Spirits" that see "bulls" and "bears" vying to set the market's future, but beyond that, there's just a hell of a lot of <em>narrative</em>.</p>
<p>Writing for <em>The American Prospect</em>, Adam M Lowenstein reviews two books that tell the histories of the stories that are used to sell American capitalism to the American people &#8211; the stories that turn workers into "temporarily embarrassed millionaires":</p>
<p><a href="https://prospect.org/culture/books/2024-02-16-stories-corporations-tell-williams-waterhouse-review/">https://prospect.org/culture/books/2024-02-16-stories-corporations-tell-williams-waterhouse-review/</a></p>
<p>The first of these books is <em>Taming the Octopus: The Long Battle for the Soul of the Corporation</em>, by Kyle Edward Williams, a kind of pre-history of "woke capitalism":</p>
<p><a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393867237">https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393867237</a></p>
<p><em>Taming</em> is a history of the low-water marks for Big Business's reputation in America, and how each was overcome through PR campaigns that declared a turning point in which business leaders would pursue the common good, even at the expense of their shareholders' interests.</p>
<p>The story starts in the 1950s, when DuPont and other massive firms had gained a well-deserved reputation as rapacious profit-generation machines that "alienated workers and pushed around small businessmen, investors, and consumers." This prompted DuPont's PR chief, Harold Brayman, to write a memo called "The Attack on Bigness," where he set out a plan to sell America on a new cuddly image for corporate giants.</p>
<p>For Brayman, the problem was that corporate execs were too shy about telling their social inferiors about all the good that businesses did for them: "The businessman is normally reluctant to talk out loud. He frequently shuns the spotlight and is content with plugging his wares, not himself."</p>
<p>This was the starting gun for a charm offensive by American big business that included IBM president Thomas Watson Jr ("I think there is a world market for about five computers") going on a speaking tour organized by McKinsey &amp; Co, where he told audiences that his company's billion dollar annual profits had convinced it to assume "responsibilities for the broader public welfare."</p>
<p>This set the template for a nationwide mania of "business statesmanship" that <em>Fortune</em> celebrated with an editorial announcing "a great transformation, of which the world as a whole is as yet unaware" that put the "profit motive&#8230;on its last leg."</p>
<p><em>Fortune</em> then spent the next seventy years recycling this announcement, every time the tide went out on business's popularity. In 2019, <em>Fortune</em> platformed IBM president Ginni Rometty for an announcement that the company was orienting its priorities to the public good: "It’s a question of whether society trusts you or not. We need society to accept what it is that we do."</p>
<p>The occasion for Rometty's quote was a special package on the Trump tax-cuts, a trillion-dollar gift to American big business, which lobbyists for the Business Roundtable celebrated with an announcement that American capitalism would now serve "stakeholders" (not just shareholders). <em>Fortune</em> celebrated this "change" as "fundamental and profound."</p>
<p>Fast forward five years and corporate leaders are still telling stories, this time about "stakeholder capitalism" and "ESG" &#8211; the dread "woke capitalism" that has right-wing swivel-eyed loons running around, hair afire, declaring the end of capitalism.</p>
<p>For Williams and Lowenstein (and me), all this ESG, DEI, and responsible capitalism is just window dressing, a distraction to keep the pitchforks and torches in people's closets, and to keep the guillotines in their packaging. The right-wing is doing a mirror-world version of liberals who freak out when OpenAI claims to have built a machine that will pauperize every worker &#8211; assuming that a PR pitch is the gospel truth, and then repeating it in criticism. Criti-hype, in other words:</p>
<p><a href="https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5">https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5</a></p>
<p>Think of ESG: the right is freaking out that ESG is harming shareholders by leaving hydrocarbons in the ground to appease climate-addled greenies. The reality is that ESG is barely disguised greenwashing, and it's fully compatible with burning every critter that died in the Mesozoic, Cenozoic, and lo, even the Paleozoic:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/15/sanctions-financing/#profiteers">https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/15/sanctions-financing/#profiteers</a></p>
<p>The reason this tactic is so successful is that Americans have also been sold <em>another</em> narrative: that American problems are solved by American individuals as entrepreneurs and businesspeople, not as polities or as members of a union (let alone the working class!).</p>
<p>This is the subject of the second book Lowenstein reviews, <em>One Day I’ll Work for Myself: The Dream and Delusion That Conquered America</em>, by Benjamin Waterhouse:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/one-day-ill-work-for-myself/">https://wwnorton.com/books/one-day-ill-work-for-myself/</a></p>
<p>A keystone of American narrative capitalism is the idea that the USA is a nation of small businesspeople, Jeffersonian yeoman farmsteaders of the US economy. But even a cursory examination shows that the country is ruled &#8211; economically and politically &#8211; by very large firms.</p>
<p>Uber sells itself as a way to be your own boss ("No shifts. No boss. No limits.") &#8211; even though it's a system where the <em>app</em> is your boss, and thanks to that layer of misdirection, Uber gets to be the worst conceivable boss, while its workers have no recourse in labor law:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men">https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men</a></p>
<p>In labor fights, Uber represents itself as the champion of innumerable "small businesspeople" who drive its unlicensed taxis. In consumer protection fights, Amazon claims to be fighting for "small businesspeople" who sell on its platform. In privacy fights, Facebook claims to represent "small businesspeople" who buy its surveillance advertising.</p>
<p>But large firms are actively hostile to small firms, seeing them as small-fry to be rooked or destroyed (recall that when Amazon targeted small publishers for bankruptcy-level discounts, they called the program "The Gazelle Project" and Bezos told his executives to tackle these firms "the way a cheetah pursues a sickly gazelle").</p>
<p>Decades of this tale have produced "a profound shift from a shared belief that individuals might come together to solve problems, into a collective faith in individual effort." America's long love-affair with rugged individualism was weaponized in the 1970s by corporations seeking to shed their regulatory obligation to workers, customers, and the environment.</p>
<p>As with Big Tech today, the big business lobby held up mom-and-pop businesses as the true beneficiaries of deregulation, even as they knifed these firms. A telling anecdote comes from someone who worked for the Chamber of Commerce's magazine <em>Nation's Business</em>: when this editor pointed out that many of the magazine's subscribers were small businesspeople and asked if they could start including articles relevant to mom-and-pops, the editor in chief said, "Over my dead body."</p>
<p>The neoliberal era has been an unbroken string of platitudes celebrating the small business and policies that annihilate their chances against large firms. Ronald Reagan's dewy-eyed hymns to American entrepreneurship sounded nice, but what matters is that he attempted to abolish the Small Business Administration and refused to address the 20,000 attendee "White House Conference on Small Business."</p>
<p>In the years since, American has sacrificed its small businesses while pulling out all the stops &#8211; bailouts and tax cuts and elite bankruptcy &#8211; to keep its largest firms growing. New regulations like Dodd-Frank were neutered in the name of saving mom-and-pop shops, even though the provisions that were cut already exempted small businesses.</p>
<p>Today, millions of Americans are treading water in a fetid stew of LLC-poisoning, rise-and-grind, multi-level-marketing, dropshipping and gig-work, convinced that the only way to get a better life is to pull themselves up by their bootstraps:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/10/declaration-of-interdependence/">https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/10/declaration-of-interdependence/</a></p>
<p>Narrative does a lot of work here. The American economy runs on bubbles, another form of narrative capitalism. Take AI, a subject I sincerely wish I could stop hearing about, not least because I'm certain that 99% of that thinking is being wasted on whatever residue remains after the bubble pops:</p>
<p><a href="https://locusmag.com/2023/12/commentary-cory-doctorow-what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai/">https://locusmag.com/2023/12/commentary-cory-doctorow-what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai/</a></p>
<p>AI isn't going to do your job, but its narrative may convince your boss to fire you and replace you with a bot that can't do your job. Like what happened when Air Canada hired a chatbot to answer customer inquiries and it started making shit up about bereavement discounts that the company later claimed it didn't have to honor:</p>
<p><a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/air-canada-s-chatbot-gave-a-b-c-man-the-wrong-information-now-the-airline-has-to-pay-for-the-mistake-1.6769454">https://bc.ctvnews.ca/air-canada-s-chatbot-gave-a-b-c-man-the-wrong-information-now-the-airline-has-to-pay-for-the-mistake-1.6769454</a></p>
<p>This story's been all over the news for the past couple of days, but so far as I've seen, no one has pointed out the seemingly obvious inference that this chatbot probably ripped off <em>lots</em> of people. The victim here was extraordinarily persistent, chasing a refund for 10 weeks and then going to the regulator. This guy is a six-sigma self-advocate &#8211; which implies a whole bell-curve's worth of comparatively normal people who just ate the shit-sandwich Air Canada fed them.</p>
<p>The reason AI is a winning proposition for Air Canada isn't that it can do a customer service rep's job &#8211; it can't. But the AI is a layer of indirection &#8211; like the app that is the true boss of Uber drivers &#8211; that lets Air Canada demoralize the customers it steals from into walking away from their losses.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the narrative that AI Will Change Everything Forever is powerful &#8211; more powerful than AI itself, that's for sure. Take this <em>Bloomberg</em> headline: "Nearly all wealth gained by world's rich this year comes from AI":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/nearly-all-wealth-gained-by-world-s-rich-this-year-comes-from-ai-124021600006_1.html">https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/nearly-all-wealth-gained-by-world-s-rich-this-year-comes-from-ai-124021600006_1.html</a></p>
<p>Dig in and you find even more narrative. The single largest beneficiary of AI stock gains last year was Mark Zuckerberg ($161B!). Zuck is American Narrative Capitalism's greatest practitioner: the guy who made billions peddling a series of lies, from "pivot to video" to "metaverse," leaping from one lie to the next just ahead of the mass stock-selloffs that wiped out lesser predators.</p>
<p>The Narrative Capitalism Cinematic Universe has a lot of side-plots like AI and entrepreneurship and woke capitalism, but its main narrative arc was articulated, ad nauseum, by Margaret Thatcher: "There is no alternative." This is the most important part of the story, the part that says it literally can't be otherwise. The only way to organize society is through markets, and the only way to organize markets is to leave them alone, no matter how much suffering they cause.</p>
<p>This is a baffling story, because it's so easily disproved. Zuck says the only way to have friends is to let him surveil you from asshole to appetite, <em>even though he once ran Facebook as the privacy-forward alternative to MySpace, and promised never to spy on you</em>:</p>
<p><a href="https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1128876">https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1128876</a></p>
<p>Likewise, the business leaders &#8211; and their chorus of dutiful Renfields &#8211; who insist that monopoly is the natural and inevitable outcome of any market economy just handwave away the decades during which anti-monopoly enforcement actually kept most businesses from getting too big to fail and too big to jail.</p>
<p>I'm no champion of market efficiency &#8211; especially not as the best and final arbiter of social and economic questions &#8211; but when I hear my comrades repeating the Thatcherite claims that all forms of capitalism <em>necessarily</em> degrade into monopolistic quagmires, that there is no alternative, it sounds like more criti-hype.</p>
<p>This is a frequent point of departure during discussions of enshittification: some people dismiss the whole idea of enshittification as "just capitalism." But we had decades of digital services that either didn't degrade, or, when they did, were replaced by superior competitors with a minimum of switching costs for users who migrated from the decaying incumbent to greener pastures.</p>
<p>The reality is that while there are problems with all forms of capitalism, there are different <em>kinds</em> of capitalist problems, and some forms of capitalism are less harmful to working people and more capable of enacting and enforcing sound policy than others.</p>
<p>Enshittification is what happens when the <em>constraints</em> on the worst impulses of companies and their investors and managers are removed. When a company doesn't have competitors, when it can capture its regulators to trample our rights with impunity, when it can enlist those regulators to shut down would-be competitors who might free us from its "walled garden," and when it can fire any worker who refuses to enact harm upon the users they serve, then that company will enshittify:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel">https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel</a></p>
<p>A company can be made to treat you well, even if it is run by a wicked person who sees you as a mark to be fleeced &#8211; that mustache twirler just has to be constrained &#8211; by competition, regulation, self-help and labor. He may still hate you and wish you harm, but he won't be able to act on it.</p>
<p>As MLK said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, religion and education will have to do that, but it can restrain him from lynching me. And I think that's pretty important also. And so that while legislation may not change the hearts of men, it does change the habits of men. And we see this every day.

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links How a billionaire's mediocre pump-and-dump "book" became a "bestseller": A convincer to prolong the bezzle. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading How a billionaire's mediocre pump-and-dump "book" became a "bestseller" (permalink) I was on a book tour the day my editor called me and told me, "From now on, your middle name is 'Cory.'" "That's weird. Why?" "Because from now on, your first name is 'New York Times Bestselling Author.'" That was how I found out I'd hit the NYT list for the first time. It was a huge moment &#8211; just as it has been each subsequent time it's happened. First, because of how it warmed my little ego, but second, and more importantly, because of how it affected my book and all the books afterwards. Once your book is a Times bestseller, every bookseller in America orders enough copies to fill a front-facing display on a new release shelf or a stack on a bestseller table. They order more copies of your backlist. Foreign rights buyers at Frankfurt crowd around your international agents to bid on your book. Movie studios come calling. It's a huge deal. My books became Times bestsellers the old-fashioned way: people bought and read them and told their friends, who bought and read them. Booksellers who enjoyed them wrote "shelf-talkers" &#8211; short reviews &#8211; and displayed them alongside the book. That "From now on your first name is 'New York Times Bestselling Author' gag is a tradition. When Wil Wheaton's memoir Still Just A Geek hit the Times list, I texted the joke to him and he texted back to say John Scalzi had already sent him the same joke (and of course, Scalzi and I have the same editor, Patrick Nielsen Hayden): https://www.harpercollins.com/products/still-just-a-geek-wil-wheaton But not everyone earns that first name the same way. Some people cheat. Famously, the Church of Scientology was caught buying truckloads of L Ron Hubbard books (published by Scientology's own publishing arm) from booksellers, returning them to their warehouse, then shipping them back to the booksellers when they re-ordered the sold out titles. The tip-off came when booksellers opened cases of books and found that they already bore the store's own price-stickers: https://www.latimes.com/local/la-scientology062890-story.html The reason Scientology was willing to go to such great lengths wasn't merely that readers used "NYT Bestseller" to choose which books to buy. Far more important was the signal that this sent to the entire book trade, from reviewers to librarians to booksellers, who made important decisions about how many copies of the books to stock, whether to display them spine or face out, and whether to return unsold stock or leave it on the shelf. Publishers go to great lengths to send these messages to the trade: sending out fancy advance review copies in elaborate packaging, taking out ads in the trade magazines, featuring titles in their catalogs and sending their sales-force out to impress the publisher's enthusiasm on their accounts. Even the advance can be a way to signal the trade: when a publisher announces that it just acquired a book for an eyebrow-raising sum, it's not trumpeting the size of its capital reserves &#8211; it's telling the trade that this book is a Big Deal that they should pay attention to. (Of all the signals, this one may be the weakest, even if it's the most expensive for publishers to send. Take the $1.25m advance that Rupert Murdoch's Harpercollins paid to Sarah Palin for her unreadable memoir, Going Rogue. As with so many of the outsized sums Murdoch's press and papers pay to right wing politicians, the figure didn't represent a bet on the commercial prospects of the book &#8211; which tanked &#8211; but rather, a legal way to launder massive cash transfers from the far-right billionaire to a generation of politicians who now owe him some rather expensive favors.) All of which brings me to the New York Times bestselling book Read Write Own by the billionaire VC New York Times Bestselling Author Chris Dixon. Dixon is a partner at A16Z, the venture capitalists who pumped billions into failed, scammy, cryptocurrency companies that tricked normies into converting their perfectly cromulent "fiat" money into shitcoins, allowing the investors to turn a massive profit and exit before the companies collapsed or imploded. Read Write Own (subtitle: "Building the Next Era of the Internet") is a monumentally unconvincing hymn to the blockchain. As Molly White writes in her scathing review, the book is full of undisclosed conflicts of interest, with Dixon touting companies he has a direct personal stake in: https://www.citationneeded.news/review-read-write-own-by-chris-dixon/ But this book's defects go beyond this kind of sleazy pump-and-dump behavior. It's also just bad. The arguments it makes for the blockchain as a way of escaping the problems of an enshittified, monopolized internet are bad arguments. White dissects each of these arguments very skillfully, and I urge you to read her review for a full list, but I'll reproduce one here to give you a taste: After three chapters in which Dixon provides a (rather revisionistd) history of the web to date, explains the mechanics of blockchains, and goes over the types of things one might theoretically be able to do with a blockchain, we are left with "Part Four: Here and Now", then the final "Part Five: What's Next". The name of Part Four suggests that he will perhaps lay out a list of blockchain projects that are currently successfully solving real problems. This may be why Part Four is precisely four and a half pages long. And rather than name any successful projects, Dixon instead spends his few pages excoriating the "casino" projects that he says have given crypto a bad rap, prompting regulatory scrutiny that is making "ethical entrepreneurs &#8230; afraid to build products" in the United States. As White says, this is just not a good book. It doesn't contain anything to excite people who are already blockchain-poisoned crypto cultists &#8211; and it also lacks anything that will convince normies who never let Matt Damon or Spike Lee convince them to trade dollars for magic beans. It's one of those books that manages to be both paper and a paperweight. And yet&#8230;it's a New York Times Bestseller. How did this come to pass? Here's a hint: remember how the Scientologists got L Ron Hubbard 20 consecutive #1 Bestsellers? As Jordan Pearson writes for Motherboard, Read Write Own earned its place on the Times list because of a series of massive bulk orders from firms linked to A16Z and Dixon, which ordered between dozens and thousands of copies and gave them away to employees or just randos on Twitter: https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7emkx/chris-dixon-a16z-read-write-own-nyt-bestseller The Times recognizes this in a backhanded way, by marking Read Write Own on the list with a "dagger" (†) that indicates the shenanigans (the same dagger appeared alongside the listing for Donald Trump Jr's Triggered after the RNC spent a metric scientologyload of money &#8211; $100k &#8211; buying up cases of it): https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/books/donald-trump-jr-triggered-sales.html There's a case for the Times not automatically ignoring bulk orders. Since 2020, I've run Kickstarters where I've pre-sold my books on behalf of my publisher, working with bookstores like Book Soup and wholesalers like Porchlight Books to backers when they go on sale. I signed and personalized 500+ books at Vroman's yesterday for backers who pre-ordered my next novel, The Bezzle: https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/53531243480/ But there's a world of difference between pre-orders that hundreds or thousands of readers place that are aggregated into a single bulk order, and books that are bought by CEOs to give away to people who may not have any interest in them. For the book trade &#8211; librarians, reviewers, booksellers &#8211; the former indicates broad interest that justifies their attention. The latter just tells you that a handful of deep-pocketed manipulators want you to think there's broad interest. I'm certain that Dixon &#8211; like me &#8211; feels a bit of pride at having "earned" a new first name. But Dixon &#8211; like me &#8211; gets something far more tangible than a bit of egoboo out of making the Times list. For me, a place on the Times list is a way to get booksellers and librarians excited about sharing my book with readers. For Dixon, the stakes are much higher. Remember that cryptocurrency is a faith-based initiative whose mechanism is: "convince normies that shitcoins will be worth more tomorrow than they are today, and then trade them the shitcoins that cost you nothing to create for dollars that they worked hard to earn." In other words, crypto is a bezzle, defined by John Kenneth Galbraith as "The magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it." So long as shitcoins haven't fallen to zero, the bag-holders who've traded their "fiat" for funny money can live in the bezzle, convinced that their "investments" will recover and turn a profit. More importantly, keeping the bezzle alive preserves the possibility of luring in more normies who can infuse the system with fresh dollars to use as convincers that keep the bag-holders to keep holding that bag, rather than bailing and precipitating the zeroing out of the whole scam. The relatively small sums that Dixon and his affiliated plutocrats spent to flood your podcasts with ads for this pointless 300-page Ponzi ad are a bargain, as are the sums they spent buying up cases of the book to give away or just stash in a storeroom. If only a few hundred retirees are convinced to convert their savings to crypto, the resulting flush of cash will make the line go up, allowing whales like Dixon and A16Z to cash out, or make more leveraged bets, or both. Crypto is a system with very few good trades, but spending chump change to earn a spot on the Times list (dagger or no) is a no-brainer. After all, the kinds of people who buy crypto are, famously, the kinds of people who think books are stupid ("I would never read a book" -S Bankman-Fried): https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/29/sam-bankman-fried-reading-effective-altruism/ There's precious little likelihood that anyone will be convinced to go long on crypto thanks to the words in this book. But the Times list has enough prestige to lure more suckers into the casino: "I'm not going to read this thing, but if it's on the list, that means other people must have read it and think it's convincing." We are living through a golden age of scams, and crypto, which has elevated caveat emptor to a moral virtue ("not your wallet, not your coins"), is a scammer's paradise. Stein's Law tells us that "anything that can't go on forever will eventually stop," but the purpose of a bezzle isn't to keep the scam going forever &#8211; just until the scammer can cash out and blow town. The longer the bezzle goes on for, the richer the scammer gets. Not for nothing, my next novel &#8211; which comes out on Feb 20 &#8211; is called The Bezzle. It stars Marty Hench, my hard-driving, two-fisted, high-tech forensic accountant, who finds himself unwinding a whole menagerie of scams, from a hamburger-based Ponzi scheme to rampant music royalty theft to a vast prison-tech scam that uses prisoners as the ultimate captive audience: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle Patrick Nielsen Hayden &#8211; the same editor who gave me my new first name &#8211; once told me that "publishing is the act of connecting a text with an audience." Everything else a publisher does &#8211; editing, printing, warehousing, distributing &#8211; can be separated from publishing. The one thing a publisher does that makes them a publisher &#8211; not a printer or a warehouser or an editing shop &#8211; is connecting books and audiences. Seen in this light, publishing is a subset of the hard problem of advertising, religion, politics and every other endeavor that consists in part of convincing people to try out a new idea: https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/04/self-publishing/ This may be the golden age of scams, but it's the dark age of publishing. Consolidation in distribution has gutted the power of the sales force to convince booksellers to stock books that the publisher believes in. Consolidation in publishing &#8211; especially Amazon, which is both a publisher and the largest retailer in the country &#8211; has stacked the deck against books looking for readers and vice-versa (Goodreads, a service founded for that purpose, is now just another tentacle on the Amazon shoggoth). The rapid enshittification of social media has clobbered the one semi-reliable channel publicists and authors had to reach readers directly. I wrote nine books during lockdown (I write as displacement activity for anxiety) which has given me a chance to see publishing in the way that few authors can: through a sequence of rapid engagements with the system as a whole, as I publish between one and three books per year for multiple, consecutive years. From that vantage point, I can tell you that it's grim and getting grimmer. The slots that books that connected with readers once occupied are now increasingly occupied by the equivalent of the botshit that fills the first eight screens of your Google search results: book-shaped objects that have gamed their way to the top of the list. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/03/botshit-generative-ai-imminent-threat-democracy I don't know what to do about this, but I have one piece of advice: if you read a book you love, tell other people about it. Tell them face-to-face. In your groupchat. On social media. Even on Goodreads. Every book is a lottery ticket, but the bezzlers are buying their tickets by the case: every time you tell someone about a book you loved (and even better, why you loved it), you buy a writer another ticket. Meanwhile, I've got to go get ready for my book tour. I'm coming to LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver, Calgary, Phoenix, Portland, Providence, Boston, New York City, Toronto, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Tucson, Chicago, Buffalo, as well as Torino and Tartu (details soon!).

<h1>How a billionaire's mediocre pump-and-dump "book" became a "bestseller" (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/15/your-new-first-name/#that-dagger-tho">permalink</a>)</h1>
<p>I was on a book tour the day my editor called me and told me, "From now on, your middle name is 'Cory.'"</p>
<p>"That's weird. Why?"</p>
<p>"Because from now on, your first name is '<em>New York Times</em> Bestselling Author.'"</p>
<p>That was how I found out I'd hit the <em>NYT</em> list for the first time. It was a huge moment &#8211; just as it has been each subsequent time it's happened. First, because of how it warmed my little ego, but second, and more importantly, because of how it affected my book and all the books afterwards.</p>
<p>Once your book is a <em>Times</em> bestseller, every bookseller in America orders enough copies to fill a front-facing display on a new release shelf or a stack on a bestseller table. They order more copies of your backlist. Foreign rights buyers at Frankfurt crowd around your international agents to bid on your book. Movie studios come calling. It's a huge deal.</p>
<p>My books became <em>Times</em> bestsellers the old-fashioned way: people bought and read them and told their friends, who bought and read them. Booksellers who enjoyed them wrote "shelf-talkers" &#8211; short reviews &#8211; and displayed them alongside the book.</p>
<p>That "From now on your first name is '<em>New York Times</em> Bestselling Author' gag is a tradition. When Wil Wheaton's memoir <em>Still Just A Geek</em> hit the <em>Times</em> list, I texted the joke to him and he texted back to say John Scalzi had <em>already</em> sent him the same joke (and of course, Scalzi and I have the same editor, Patrick Nielsen Hayden):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/still-just-a-geek-wil-wheaton">https://www.harpercollins.com/products/still-just-a-geek-wil-wheaton</a></p>
<p>But not everyone earns that first name the same way. Some people cheat.</p>
<p>Famously, the Church of Scientology was caught buying truckloads of L Ron Hubbard books (published by Scientology's own publishing arm) from booksellers, returning them to their warehouse, then shipping them back to the booksellers when they re-ordered the sold out titles. The tip-off came when booksellers opened cases of books and found that they already bore the store's own price-stickers:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/la-scientology062890-story.html">https://www.latimes.com/local/la-scientology062890-story.html</a></p>
<p>The reason Scientology was willing to go to such great lengths wasn't merely that readers used "NYT Bestseller" to choose which books to buy. Far more important was the signal that this sent to the entire book trade, from reviewers to librarians to booksellers, who made important decisions about how many copies of the books to stock, whether to display them spine or face out, and whether to return unsold stock or leave it on the shelf.</p>
<p>Publishers go to great lengths to send these messages to the trade: sending out fancy advance review copies in elaborate packaging, taking out ads in the trade magazines, featuring titles in their catalogs and sending their sales-force out to impress the publisher's enthusiasm on their accounts.</p>
<p>Even the advance can be a way to signal the trade: when a publisher announces that it just acquired a book for an eyebrow-raising sum, it's not trumpeting the size of its capital reserves &#8211; it's telling the trade that this book is a Big Deal that they should pay attention to.</p>
<p>(Of all the signals, this one may be the weakest, even if it's the most expensive for publishers to send. Take the $1.25m advance that Rupert Murdoch's Harpercollins paid to Sarah Palin for her unreadable memoir, <em>Going Rogue</em>. As with so many of the outsized sums Murdoch's press and papers pay to right wing politicians, the figure didn't represent a bet on the commercial prospects of the book &#8211; which tanked &#8211; but rather, a legal way to launder massive cash transfers from the far-right billionaire to a generation of politicians who now owe him some rather expensive favors.)</p>
<p>All of which brings me to the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling book <em>Read Write Own</em> by the billionaire VC <em>New York Times</em> Bestselling Author Chris Dixon. Dixon is a partner at A16Z, the venture capitalists who pumped billions into failed, scammy, cryptocurrency companies that tricked normies into converting their perfectly cromulent "fiat" money into shitcoins, allowing the investors to turn a massive profit and exit before the companies collapsed or imploded.</p>
<p><em>Read Write Own</em> (subtitle: "Building the Next Era of the Internet") is a monumentally unconvincing hymn to the blockchain. As Molly White writes in her scathing review, the book is full of undisclosed conflicts of interest, with Dixon touting companies he has a direct personal stake in:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/review-read-write-own-by-chris-dixon/">https://www.citationneeded.news/review-read-write-own-by-chris-dixon/</a></p>
<p>But this book's defects go beyond this kind of sleazy pump-and-dump behavior. It's also just <em>bad</em>. The arguments it makes for the blockchain as a way of escaping the problems of an enshittified, monopolized internet are bad arguments. White dissects each of these arguments very skillfully, and I urge you to read her review for a full list, but I'll reproduce one here to give you a taste:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  After three chapters in which Dixon provides a (rather revisionistd) history of the web to date, explains the mechanics of blockchains, and goes over the types of things one might theoretically be able to do with a blockchain, we are left with "Part Four: Here and Now", then the final "Part Five: What's Next". The name of Part Four suggests that he will perhaps lay out a list of blockchain projects that are currently successfully solving real problems.</p>
<p>  This may be why Part Four is precisely four and a half pages long. And rather than name any successful projects, Dixon instead spends his few pages excoriating the "casino" projects that he says have given crypto a bad rap, prompting regulatory scrutiny that is making "ethical entrepreneurs &#8230; afraid to build products" in the United States.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As White says, this is just not a good book. It doesn't contain anything to excite people who are already blockchain-poisoned crypto cultists &#8211; and it <em>also</em> lacks anything that will convince normies who never let Matt Damon or Spike Lee convince them to trade dollars for magic beans. It's one of those books that manages to be both paper <em>and</em> a paperweight.</p>
<p>And yet&#8230;it's a <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller. How did this come to pass? Here's a hint: remember how the Scientologists got L Ron Hubbard 20 consecutive #1 Bestsellers?</p>
<p>As Jordan Pearson writes for <em>Motherboard</em>, <em>Read Write Own</em> earned its place on the <em>Times</em> list because of a series of massive bulk orders from firms linked to A16Z and Dixon, which ordered between dozens and thousands of copies and gave them away to employees or just randos on Twitter:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7emkx/chris-dixon-a16z-read-write-own-nyt-bestseller">https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7emkx/chris-dixon-a16z-read-write-own-nyt-bestseller</a></p>
<p>The <em>Times</em> recognizes this in a backhanded way, by marking <em>Read Write Own</em> on the list with a "dagger" (†) that indicates the shenanigans (the same dagger appeared alongside the listing for Donald Trump Jr's <em>Triggered</em> after the RNC spent a metric scientologyload of money &#8211; $100k &#8211; buying up cases of it):</p>

<p>There's a case for the <em>Times</em> not automatically ignoring bulk orders. Since 2020, I've run Kickstarters where I've pre-sold my books on behalf of my publisher, working with bookstores like Book Soup and wholesalers like Porchlight Books to backers when they go on sale. I signed and personalized 500+ books at Vroman's yesterday for backers who pre-ordered my next novel, <em>The Bezzle</em>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/53531243480/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/53531243480/</a></p>
<p>But there's a world of difference between pre-orders that hundreds or thousands of readers place that are aggregated into a single bulk order, and books that are bought by CEOs to give away to people who may not have any interest in them. For the book trade &#8211; librarians, reviewers, booksellers &#8211; the former indicates broad interest that justifies their attention. The latter just tells you that a handful of deep-pocketed manipulators want you to <em>think</em> there's broad interest.</p>
<p>I'm certain that Dixon &#8211; like me &#8211; feels a bit of pride at having "earned" a new first name. But Dixon &#8211; like me &#8211; gets something far more tangible than a bit of egoboo out of making the <em>Times</em> list. For me, a place on the <em>Times</em> list is a way to get booksellers and librarians excited about sharing my book with readers.</p>
<p>For Dixon, the stakes are much higher. Remember that cryptocurrency is a faith-based initiative whose mechanism is: "convince normies that shitcoins will be worth more tomorrow than they are today, and then trade them the shitcoins that cost you nothing to create for dollars that they worked hard to earn."</p>
<p>In other words, crypto is a <em>bezzle</em>, defined by John Kenneth Galbraith as "The magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it."</p>
<p>So long as shitcoins haven't fallen to zero, the bag-holders who've traded their "fiat" for funny money can live in the bezzle, convinced that their "investments" will recover and turn a profit. More importantly, keeping the bezzle alive preserves the possibility of luring in more normies who can infuse the system with fresh dollars to use as convincers that keep the bag-holders to keep holding that bag, rather than bailing and precipitating the zeroing out of the whole scam.</p>
<p>The relatively small sums that Dixon and his affiliated plutocrats spent to flood your podcasts with ads for this pointless 300-page Ponzi ad are a <em>bargain</em>, as are the sums they spent buying up cases of the book to give away or just stash in a storeroom. If only a few hundred retirees are convinced to convert their savings to crypto, the resulting flush of cash will make the line go up, allowing whales like Dixon and A16Z to cash out, or make more leveraged bets, or both. Crypto is a system with very few good trades, but spending chump change to earn a spot on the <em>Times</em> list (dagger or no) is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>After all, the kinds of people who buy crypto are, famously, the kinds of people who think books are stupid ("I would never read a book" -S Bankman-Fried):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/29/sam-bankman-fried-reading-effective-altruism/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/29/sam-bankman-fried-reading-effective-altruism/</a></p>
<p>There's precious little likelihood that anyone will be convinced to go long on crypto thanks to the <em>words</em> in this book. But the <em>Times</em> list has enough prestige to lure more suckers into the casino: "<em>I'm</em> not going to read this thing, but if it's on the list, that means <em>other</em> people <em>must</em> have read it and think it's convincing."</p>
<p>We are living through a golden age of scams, and crypto, which has elevated caveat emptor to a moral virtue ("not your wallet, not your coins"), is a scammer's paradise. Stein's Law tells us that "anything that can't go on forever will eventually stop," but the purpose of a bezzle isn't to keep the scam going forever &#8211; just until the scammer can cash out and blow town. The longer the bezzle goes on for, the richer the scammer gets.</p>
<p>Not for nothing, my next novel &#8211; which comes out on Feb 20 &#8211; is called <em>The Bezzle.</em> It stars Marty Hench, my hard-driving, two-fisted, high-tech forensic accountant, who finds himself unwinding a whole menagerie of scams, from a hamburger-based Ponzi scheme to rampant music royalty theft to a vast prison-tech scam that uses prisoners as the ultimate captive audience:</p>

<p>Patrick Nielsen Hayden &#8211; the same editor who gave me my new first name &#8211; once told me that "publishing is the act of connecting a text with an audience." Everything else a publisher does &#8211; editing, printing, warehousing, distributing &#8211; can be separated from publishing. The one thing a publisher does that makes them a publisher &#8211; not a printer or a warehouser or an editing shop &#8211; is <em>connecting books and audiences</em>.</p>
<p>Seen in this light, publishing is a subset of the hard problem of advertising, religion, politics and every other endeavor that consists in part of convincing people to try out a new idea:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/04/self-publishing/">https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/04/self-publishing/</a></p>
<p>This may be the golden age of scams, but it's the dark age of publishing. Consolidation in distribution has gutted the power of the sales force to convince booksellers to stock books that the publisher believes in. Consolidation in publishing &#8211; especially Amazon, which is both a publisher and the largest retailer in the country &#8211; has stacked the deck against books looking for readers and vice-versa (Goodreads, a service founded for that purpose, is now just another tentacle on the Amazon shoggoth). The rapid enshittification of social media has clobbered the one semi-reliable channel publicists and authors had to reach readers directly.</p>
<p>I wrote nine books during lockdown (I write as displacement activity for anxiety) which has given me a chance to see publishing in the way that few authors can: through a sequence of rapid engagements with the system as a whole, as I publish between one and three books per year for multiple, consecutive years. From that vantage point, I can tell you that it's grim and getting grimmer. The slots that books that connected with readers once occupied are now increasingly occupied by the equivalent of the botshit that fills the first eight screens of your Google search results: book-shaped objects that have gamed their way to the top of the list.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/03/botshit-generative-ai-imminent-threat-democracy">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/03/botshit-generative-ai-imminent-threat-democracy</a></p>
<p>I don't know what to do about this, but I have one piece of advice: if you read a book you love, <em>tell other people</em> about it. Tell them face-to-face. In your groupchat. On social media. Even on Goodreads. Every book is a lottery ticket, but the bezzlers are buying their tickets by the case: every time you tell someone about a book you loved (and even better, <em>why</em> you loved it), you buy a writer another ticket.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I've got to go get ready for my book tour. I'm coming to LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver, Calgary, Phoenix, Portland, Providence, Boston, New York City, Toronto, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Tucson, Chicago, Buffalo, as well as Torino and Tartu (details soon!).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links Prison-tech is a brutal scam &#8211; and a harbinger of your future: My next novel predicts the present. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2013, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Prison-tech is a brutal scam &#8211; and a harbinger of your future (permalink) Here's how the shitty technology adoption curve works: when you want to roll out a new, abusive technology, look for a group of vulnerable people whose complaints are roundly ignored and subject them to your bad idea. Sand the rough edges off on their bodies and lives. Normalize the technological abuse you seek to inflict. Next: work your way up the privilege gradient. Maybe you start with prisoners, then work your way up to asylum seekers, parolees and mental patients. Then try it on kids and gig workers. Now, college students and blue collar workers. Climb that curve, bit by bit, until you've reached its apex and everyone is living with your shitty technology: https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware Prisoners, asylum seekers, drug addicts and other marginalized people are the involuntary early adopters of every form of disciplinary technology. They are the leading indicators of the ways that technology will be ruining your life in the future. They are the harbingers of all our technological doom. Which brings me to Minnesota. Minnesota is one of the first states to make prison phone-calls free. This is a big deal, because prison phone-calls are a big business. Prisoners are literally a captive audience, and the telecommunications sector is populated by sociopaths, bred and trained to spot and exploit abusive monopoly opportunities. As states across America locked up more and more people for longer and longer terms, the cost of operating prisons skyrocketed, even as states slashed taxes on the rich and turned a blind eye to tax evasion. This presented telco predators with an unbeatable opportunity: they approached state prison operators and offered them a bargain: "Let us take over the telephone service to your carceral facility and we will levy eye-watering per-minute charges on the most desperate people in the world. Their families &#8211; struggling with one breadwinner behind bars &#8211; will find the money to pay this ransom, and we'll split the profits with you, the cash-strapped, incarceration-happy state government." This was the opening salvo, and it turned into a fantastic little money-spinner. Prison telco companies and state prison operators were the public-private partnership from hell. Prison-tech companies openly funneled money to state coffers in the form of kickbacks, even as they secretly bribed prison officials to let them gouge their inmates and inmates' families: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/02/mississippi-corrections-corruption-bribery-private-prison-hustle/ As digital technology got cheaper and prison-tech companies got greedier, the low end of the shitty tech adoption curve got a lot more crowded. Prison-tech companies started handing out "free" cheap Android tablets to prisoners, laying the groundwork for the next phase of the scam. Once prisoners had tablets, prisons could get rid of phones altogether and charge prisoners &#8211; and their families &#8211; even higher rates to place calls right to the prisoner's cell. Then, prisons could end in-person visits and replace them with sub-skype, postage-stamp-sized videoconferencing, at rates even higher than the voice-call rates. Combine that with a ban on mailing letters to and from prisoners &#8211; replaced with a service that charged even higher rates to scan mail sent to prisoners, and then charged prisoners to download the scans &#8211; and prison-tech companies could claim to be at the vanguard of prison safety, ending the smuggling of dope-impregnated letters and other contraband into the prison system. Prison-tech invented some wild shit, like the "digital stamp," a mainstay of industry giant Jpay, which requires prisoners to pay for "stamps" to send or receive a "page" of email. If you're keeping score, you've realized that this is a system where prisoners and their families have to pay for calls, "in-person" visits, handwritten letters, and email. It goes on: prisons shuttered their libraries and replaced them with ebook stores that charged 2-4 times the prices you'd pay for books on the outside. Prisoners were sold digital music at 200-300% markups relative to, say, iTunes. Remember, these are prisoners: locked up for years or decades, decades during which their families scraped by with a breadwinner behind bars. Prisoners can earn money, sure &#8211; as much as $0.89/hour, doing forced labor for companies that contract with prisons for their workforce: https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2017/04/10/wages/ Of course, there's the odd chance for prisoners to make really big bucks &#8211; $2-5/day. All they have to do is "volunteer" to fight raging wildfires: https://www.hcn.org/articles/climate-desk-wildfire-california-incarcerated-firefighters-face-dangerous-work-low-pay-and-covid19/ So those $3 digital music tracks are being bought by people earning as little as $0.10/hour. Which makes it especially galling when prisons change prison-tech suppliers, whereupon all that digital music is deleted, wiping prisoners' media collection out &#8211; forever (literally, for prisoners serving life terms): https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/captive-audience-how-floridas-prisons-and-drm-made-113m-worth-prisoners-music Let's recap: America goes on a prison rampage, locking up ever-larger numbers of people for ever-longer sentences. Once inside, prisoners had their access to friends and family rationed, along with access to books, music, education and communities outside. This is very bad for prisoners &#8211; strong ties to people outside are closely tied to successful reentry &#8211; but it's great for state budgets, and for wardens, thanks to kickbacks: https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2021/12/21/family_contact/ Back to Minnesota: when Minnesota became the fourth state in the USA where the state, not prisoners, would pay for prison calls, it seemed like they were finally breaking the vicious cycle in which every dollar ripped off of prisoners' family paid 40 cents to the state treasury: https://www.kaaltv.com/news/no-cost-phone-calls-for-those-incarcerated-in-minnesota/ But &#8211; as Katya Schwenk writes for The Lever &#8211; what happened next is "a case study in how prison communication companies and their private equity owners have managed to preserve their symbiotic relationship with state corrections agencies despite reforms — at the major expense of incarcerated people and their families": https://www.levernews.com/wall-streets-new-prison-scam/ Immediately after the state ended the ransoming of prisoners' phone calls, the private-equity backed prison-tech companies that had dug their mouth-parts into the state's prison jacked up the price of all their other digital services. For example, the price of a digital song in a Minnesota prison just jumped from $1.99 to $2.36 (for prisoners earning as little as $0.25/hour). As Paul Wright from the Human Rights Defense Center told Schwenk, "The ideal world for the private equity owners of these companies is every prisoner has one of their tablets, and every one of those tablets is hooked up to the bank account of someone outside of prison that they can just drain." The state's new prison-tech supplier promises to double the amount of kickbacks it pays the state each year, thanks to an aggressive expansion into games, money transfers, and other "services." The perverse incentive isn't hard to spot: the more these prison-tech companies charge, the more kickbacks they pay to the prisons. The primary prison-tech company for Minnesota's prisons is Viapath (nee Global Tel Link), which pioneered price-gouging on in-prison phone calls. Viapath has spent the past two decades being bought and sold by different private equity firms: Goldman Sachs, Veritas Capital, and now the $46b/year American Securities. Viapath competes with another private equity-backed prison-tech giant: Aventiv (Securus, Jpay), owned by Platinum Equity. Together, Viapath and Aventiv control 90% of the prison-tech market. These companies have a rap-sheet as long as your arm: bribing wardens, stealing from prisoners and their families, and recording prisoner-attorney calls. But these are the kinds of crimes the state punishes with fines and settlements &#8211; not by terminating its contracts with these predators. These companies continue to flout the law. Minnesota's new free-calls system bans prison-tech companies from paying kickbacks to prisons and prison-officials for telcoms services, so the prison-tech companies have rebranded ebooks, music, and money-transfers as non-communications products, and the kickbacks are bigger than ever. This is the bottom end of the shitty technology adoption curve. Long before Ubisoft started deleting games that you'd bought a "perpetual license" for, prisoners were having their media ganked by an uncaring corporation that knew it was untouchable: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIqyvquTEVU Revoking your media, charging by the byte for messaging, confiscating things in the name of security and then selling them back to you &#8211; these are all tactics that were developed in the prison system, refined, normalized, and then worked up the privilege gradient. Prisoners are living in your technology future. It's just not evenly distributed &#8211; yet. As it happens, prison-tech is at the heart of my next novel, The Bezzle, which comes out on Feb 20. This is a followup to last year's bestselling Red Team Blues, which introduced the world to Marty Hench, a two-fisted, hard-bitten, high-tech forensic accountant who's spent 40 years busting Silicon Valley finance scams: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle In The Bezzle, we travel with Marty back to the mid 2000s (Hench is a kind of tech-scam Zelig and every book is a standalone tale of high-tech ripoffs from a different time and place). Marty's trying to help his old pal Scott Warms, a once-high-flying founder who's fallen prey to California's three-strikes law and is now facing decades in a state pen. As bad as things are, they get worse when the prison starts handing out "free" tablets and closing down the visitation room, the library, and the payphones. This is an entry to the thing I love most about the Hench novels: the opportunity to turn all this dry, financial skullduggery into a high-intensity, high-stakes technothriller plot. For me, Marty Hench is a tool for flensing the scam economy of all its layers of respectability bullshit and exposing the rot at the core. It's not a coincidence that I've got a book coming out in a week that's about something that's in the news right now. I didn't "predict" this current turn &#8211; I observed it. The world comes at you fast and technology news flutters past before you can register it. Luckily, I have a method for capturing this stuff as it happens: https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/ Writing about tech issues that are long-simmering but still in the periphery is a technique I call "predicting the present." It's the technique I used when I wrote Little Brother, about out-of-control state surveillance of the internet. When Snowden revealed the extent of NSA spying in 2013, people acted as though I'd "predicted" the Snowden revelations: https://www.wired.com/story/his-writing-radicalized-young-hackers-now-he-wants-to-redeem-them/ But Little Brother and Snowden's own heroic decision have a common origin: the brave whistleblower Mark Klein, who walked into EFF's offices in 2006 and revealed that he'd been ordered by his boss at AT&#38;T to install a beam-splitter into the main fiber trunk so that the NSA could illegally wiretap the entire internet: https://www.eff.org/document/public-unredacted-klein-declaration Mark Klein inspired me to write Little Brother &#8211; but despite national press attention, the Klein revelations didn't put a stop to NSA spying. The NSA was still conducting its lawless surveillance campaign in 2013, when Snowden, disgusted with NSA leadership for lying to Congress under oath, decided to blow the whistle again: https://apnews.com/article/business-33a88feb083ea35515de3c73e3d854ad The assumption that let the NSA get away with mass surveillance was that it would only be weaponized against the people at the bottom of the shitty technology adoption curve: brown people, mostly in other countries. The Snowden revelations made it clear that these were just the beginning, and sure enough, more than a decade later, we have data-brokers sucking up billions in cop kickbacks to enable warrantless surveillance, while virtually following people to abortion clinics, churches, and protests. Mass surveillance is chugging its way up the shitty tech adoption curve with no sign of stopping. Like Little Brother, The Bezzle is intended as a kind of virtual flythrough of what life is like further down on that curve &#8211; a way for readers who have too much agency to be in the crosshairs of a company like Viapath or Avently right now to wake up before that kind of technology comes for them, and to inspire them to take up the cause of the people further down the curve who are mired in it. The Bezzle is an intense book, but it's also a very fun story &#8211; just like Little Brother. It's a book that lays bare the internal technical workings of so many scams, from multi-level marketing to real-estate investment trusts, from music royalty theft to prison-tech, in the course of an ice-cold revenge plot that keeps twisting to the very last page. It'll drop in six days.

<p>Here's how the shitty technology adoption curve works: when you want to roll out a new, abusive technology, look for a group of vulnerable people whose complaints are roundly ignored and subject them to your bad idea. Sand the rough edges off on their bodies and lives. Normalize the technological abuse you seek to inflict.</p>

<p>Prisoners, asylum seekers, drug addicts and other marginalized people are the involuntary early adopters of every form of disciplinary technology. They are the leading indicators of the ways that technology will be ruining your life in the future. They are the harbingers of all our technological doom.</p>
<p>Which brings me to Minnesota.</p>
<p>Minnesota is one of the first states to make prison phone-calls free. This is a big deal, because prison phone-calls are a big business. Prisoners are <em>literally</em> a captive audience, and the telecommunications sector is populated by sociopaths, bred and trained to spot and exploit abusive monopoly opportunities. As states across America locked up more and more people for longer and longer terms, the cost of operating prisons skyrocketed, even as states slashed taxes on the rich and turned a blind eye to tax evasion.</p>
<p>This presented telco predators with an unbeatable opportunity: they approached state prison operators and offered them a bargain: "Let us take over the telephone service to your carceral facility and we will levy eye-watering per-minute charges on the most desperate people in the world. Their families &#8211; struggling with one breadwinner behind bars &#8211; will find the money to pay this ransom, and we'll split the profits with you, the cash-strapped, incarceration-happy state government."</p>
<p>This was the opening salvo, and it turned into a fantastic little money-spinner. Prison telco companies and state prison operators were the public-private partnership from hell. Prison-tech companies openly funneled money to state coffers in the form of kickbacks, even as they secretly bribed prison officials to let them gouge their inmates and inmates' families:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/02/mississippi-corrections-corruption-bribery-private-prison-hustle/">https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/02/mississippi-corrections-corruption-bribery-private-prison-hustle/</a></p>
<p>As digital technology got cheaper and prison-tech companies got greedier, the low end of the shitty tech adoption curve got a lot more crowded. Prison-tech companies started handing out "free" cheap Android tablets to prisoners, laying the groundwork for the next phase of the scam. Once prisoners had tablets, prisons could get rid of phones altogether and charge prisoners &#8211; and their families &#8211; even higher rates to place calls right to the prisoner's cell.</p>
<p>Then, prisons could end in-person visits and replace them with sub-skype, postage-stamp-sized videoconferencing, at rates even higher than the voice-call rates. Combine that with a ban on mailing letters to and from prisoners &#8211; replaced with a service that charged even higher rates to scan mail sent to prisoners, and then charged prisoners to download the scans &#8211; and prison-tech companies could claim to be at the vanguard of prison safety, ending the smuggling of dope-impregnated letters and other contraband into the prison system.</p>
<p>Prison-tech invented some <em>wild</em> shit, like the "digital stamp," a mainstay of industry giant Jpay, which requires prisoners to pay for "stamps" to send or receive a "page" of email. If you're keeping score, you've realized that this is a system where prisoners and their families have to pay for calls, "in-person" visits, handwritten letters, <em>and</em> email.</p>
<p>It goes on: prisons shuttered their libraries and replaced them with ebook stores that charged 2-4 times the prices you'd pay for books on the outside. Prisoners were sold digital music at 200-300% markups relative to, say, iTunes.</p>
<p>Remember, these are prisoners: locked up for years or decades, decades during which their families scraped by with a breadwinner behind bars. Prisoners can earn money, sure &#8211; as much as $0.89/hour, doing forced labor for companies that contract with prisons for their workforce:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2017/04/10/wages/">https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2017/04/10/wages/</a></p>
<p>Of course, there's the odd chance for prisoners to make <em>really</em> big bucks &#8211; $2-5/day. All they have to do is "volunteer" to fight raging wildfires:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hcn.org/articles/climate-desk-wildfire-california-incarcerated-firefighters-face-dangerous-work-low-pay-and-covid19/">https://www.hcn.org/articles/climate-desk-wildfire-california-incarcerated-firefighters-face-dangerous-work-low-pay-and-covid19/</a></p>
<p>So those $3 digital music tracks are being bought by people earning as little as $0.10/hour. Which makes it especially galling when prisons change prison-tech suppliers, whereupon all that digital music is deleted, wiping prisoners' media collection out &#8211; forever (literally, for prisoners serving life terms):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/captive-audience-how-floridas-prisons-and-drm-made-113m-worth-prisoners-music">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/captive-audience-how-floridas-prisons-and-drm-made-113m-worth-prisoners-music</a></p>
<p>Let's recap: America goes on a prison rampage, locking up ever-larger numbers of people for ever-longer sentences. Once inside, prisoners had their access to friends and family rationed, along with access to books, music, education and communities outside. This is very bad for prisoners &#8211; strong ties to people outside are closely tied to successful reentry &#8211; but it's <em>great</em> for state budgets, and for wardens, thanks to kickbacks:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2021/12/21/family_contact/">https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2021/12/21/family_contact/</a></p>
<p>Back to Minnesota: when Minnesota became the fourth state in the USA where the state, not prisoners, would pay for prison calls, it seemed like they were finally breaking the vicious cycle in which every dollar ripped off of prisoners' family paid 40 cents to the state treasury:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kaaltv.com/news/no-cost-phone-calls-for-those-incarcerated-in-minnesota/">https://www.kaaltv.com/news/no-cost-phone-calls-for-those-incarcerated-in-minnesota/</a></p>
<p>But &#8211; as Katya Schwenk writes for <em>The Lever</em> &#8211; what happened next is "a case study in how prison communication companies and their private equity owners have managed to preserve their symbiotic relationship with state corrections agencies despite reforms — at the major expense of incarcerated people and their families":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.levernews.com/wall-streets-new-prison-scam/">https://www.levernews.com/wall-streets-new-prison-scam/</a></p>
<p>Immediately after the state ended the ransoming of prisoners' phone calls, the private-equity backed prison-tech companies that had dug their mouth-parts into the state's prison jacked up the price of all their other digital services. For example, the price of a digital song in a Minnesota prison just jumped from $1.99 to $2.36 (for prisoners earning as little as $0.25/hour).</p>
<p>As Paul Wright from the Human Rights Defense Center told Schwenk, "The ideal world for the private equity owners of these companies is every prisoner has one of their tablets, and every one of those tablets is hooked up to the bank account of someone outside of prison that they can just drain."</p>
<p>The state's new prison-tech supplier promises to <em>double</em> the amount of kickbacks it pays the state each year, thanks to an aggressive expansion into games, money transfers, and other "services." The perverse incentive isn't hard to spot: the more these prison-tech companies charge, the more kickbacks they pay to the prisons.</p>
<p>The primary prison-tech company for Minnesota's prisons is Viapath (nee Global Tel Link), which pioneered price-gouging on in-prison phone calls. Viapath has spent the past two decades being bought and sold by different private equity firms: Goldman Sachs, Veritas Capital, and now the $46b/year American Securities.</p>
<p>Viapath competes with another private equity-backed prison-tech giant: Aventiv (Securus, Jpay), owned by Platinum Equity. Together, Viapath and Aventiv control 90% of the prison-tech market. These companies have a rap-sheet as long as your arm: bribing wardens, stealing from prisoners and their families, and recording prisoner-attorney calls. But these are the kinds of crimes the state punishes with fines and settlements &#8211; not by terminating its contracts with these predators.</p>
<p>These companies continue to flout the law. Minnesota's new free-calls system bans prison-tech companies from paying kickbacks to prisons and prison-officials for telcoms services, so the prison-tech companies have rebranded ebooks, music, and money-transfers as non-communications products, and the kickbacks are bigger than ever.</p>
<p>This is the bottom end of the shitty technology adoption curve. Long before Ubisoft started deleting games that you'd bought a "perpetual license" for, prisoners were having their media ganked by an uncaring corporation that knew it was untouchable:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIqyvquTEVU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIqyvquTEVU</a></p>
<p>Revoking your media, charging by the byte for messaging, confiscating things in the name of security and then selling them back to you &#8211; these are all tactics that were developed in the prison system, refined, normalized, and then worked up the privilege gradient. Prisoners are living in your technology future. It's just not evenly distributed &#8211; yet.</p>
<p>As it happens, prison-tech is at the heart of my next novel, <em>The Bezzle</em>, which comes out on Feb 20. This is a followup to last year's bestselling <em>Red Team Blues</em>, which introduced the world to Marty Hench, a two-fisted, hard-bitten, high-tech forensic accountant who's spent 40 years busting Silicon Valley finance scams:</p>
<p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle</a></p>
<p>In <em>The Bezzle</em>, we travel with Marty back to the mid 2000s (Hench is a kind of tech-scam Zelig and every book is a standalone tale of high-tech ripoffs from a different time and place). Marty's trying to help his old pal Scott Warms, a once-high-flying founder who's fallen prey to California's three-strikes law and is now facing decades in a state pen. As bad as things are, they get worse when the prison starts handing out "free" tablets and closing down the visitation room, the library, and the payphones.</p>
<p>This is an entry to the thing I love most about the Hench novels: the opportunity to turn all this dry, financial skullduggery into a high-intensity, high-stakes technothriller plot. For me, Marty Hench is a tool for flensing the scam economy of all its layers of respectability bullshit and exposing the rot at the core.</p>
<p>It's not a coincidence that I've got a book coming out in a week that's about something that's in the news right now. I didn't "predict" this current turn &#8211; I <em>observed</em> it. The world comes at you fast and technology news flutters past before you can register it. Luckily, I have a method for capturing this stuff as it happens:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/">https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/</a></p>
<p>Writing about tech issues that are long-simmering but still in the periphery is a technique I call "predicting the present." It's the technique I used when I wrote <em>Little Brother</em>, about out-of-control state surveillance of the internet. When Snowden revealed the extent of NSA spying in 2013, people acted as though I'd "predicted" the Snowden revelations:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/his-writing-radicalized-young-hackers-now-he-wants-to-redeem-them/">https://www.wired.com/story/his-writing-radicalized-young-hackers-now-he-wants-to-redeem-them/</a></p>
<p>But <em>Little Brother</em> and Snowden's own heroic decision have a common origin: the brave whistleblower Mark Klein, who walked into EFF's offices in 2006 and revealed that he'd been ordered by his boss at AT&amp;T to install a beam-splitter into the main fiber trunk so that the NSA could illegally wiretap the entire internet:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/public-unredacted-klein-declaration">https://www.eff.org/document/public-unredacted-klein-declaration</a></p>
<p>Mark Klein inspired me to write <em>Little Brother</em> &#8211; but despite national press attention, the Klein revelations didn't put a stop to NSA spying. The NSA was still conducting its lawless surveillance campaign in 2013, when Snowden, disgusted with NSA leadership for lying to Congress under oath, decided to blow the whistle again:</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-33a88feb083ea35515de3c73e3d854ad">https://apnews.com/article/business-33a88feb083ea35515de3c73e3d854ad</a></p>
<p>The assumption that let the NSA get away with mass surveillance was that it would only be weaponized against the people at the bottom of the shitty technology adoption curve: brown people, mostly in other countries. The Snowden revelations made it clear that these were just the beginning, and sure enough, more than a decade later, we have data-brokers sucking up billions in cop kickbacks to enable warrantless surveillance, while virtually following people to abortion clinics, churches, and protests. Mass surveillance is chugging its way up the shitty tech adoption curve with no sign of stopping.</p>
<p>Like <em>Little Brother</em>, <em>The Bezzle</em> is intended as a kind of virtual flythrough of what life is like further down on that curve &#8211; a way for readers who have too much agency to be in the crosshairs of a company like Viapath or Avently right now to wake up before that kind of technology comes for them, and to inspire them to take up the cause of the people further down the curve who are mired in it.</p>
<p><em>The Bezzle</em> is an intense book, but it's also a very <em>fun</em> story &#8211; just like <em>Little Brother</em>. It's a book that lays bare the internal technical workings of so many scams, from multi-level marketing to real-estate investment trusts, from music royalty theft to prison-tech, in the course of an ice-cold revenge plot that keeps twisting to the very last page.</p>
<p>It'll drop in <em>six days</em>. I hope you'll check it out:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links Kelly Link's "Book of Love": A deceptively quirky tale with rusty razors at its core. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading. Kelly Link's "Book of Love" (permalink) Kelly Link is one of science fiction's most important writers, a master of the short story to rank with the likes of Ted Chiang. For a decade, Kelly's friends have traded whispers that she was working on a novel &#8211; a giant novel &#8211; and the rumors were true and the novel is glorious and you will love it: https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/book-of-love-9781804548455/ https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/239722/the-book-of-love-by-kelly-link/ It's called The Book of Love and it's massive &#8211; 650 pages! It is glorious. It is tricky. If you've read Link's short stories (which honestly, you must read), you know her signature move: a bone-dry witty delivery, used to spin tales of deceptive whimsy and quirkiness, disarming you with daffiness while she sets the hook and yanks. That's the unmistakeable, inimitable texture of a Kelly Link story: deft literary brushstrokes, painting a picture so charming and silly that you don't even notice when she cuts you without mercy. Turns out that she can quite handily do this for hundreds of pages, and the effect only gets better when it's given space to unfold. Hard to tell you about this one without spoilers! But I'll tell you this much. It's a story about three teenaged friends who return from death and find themselves in the music room at their high school, face to face with their mild-mannered music teacher, Mr Anabin. Anabin explains what's happened in frustratingly cryptic &#8211; and very emphatic &#8211; terms, but is interrupted when a sinister shape-shifting wolf enters the music room. This is Bogomil, and whenever he speaks, Mr Anabin turns his back &#8211; and vice versa. Anabin and Bogomil appear to be rivals, and Bogomil may or may not have been the keeper of the land of the dead from which the three have escaped. There's also a fourth, a tattered shade who's been dead so long they don't remember who they are or anything about themselves. Bogomil would like to take the four back to the deadlands, but Anabin proposes a contest and Bogomil agrees &#8211; but no one explains the contest or its rules (or even its stakes) to the four dead teenagers. That's the wind up. The pitch that follows is flawless, a long and twisting mystery about friendship, love, queerness, rock-and-roll, stardom, parenthood, loyalty, lust and duty. There's a terrifying elder god of Lovecraftian proportions. There are ghosts upon ghosts. There are ancient grudges. There are sudden revelations that come from unexpected angles but are, in retrospect, perfectly set up. More than anything, there are characters. It's impossible not to love Link's characters, despite (because of) their self-destructive choices and their impossible dilemmas. They are so sweet, but they are also by turns mean and spiteful and resentful, like the pinch of salt that transforms a caramel from inedible spun sugar into something that bites even as it delights. These characters, so very likable, are often dead or at death's door, and that peril propels the story like an unstoppable locomotive. From the very start, it's clear that some of them can't survive to the end, and Link is merciless in making you root for all of them, even though this means rooting against them all. This, in turn, creates moments of toe-curling, sublime horror. Link has built a complex machine with more moving parts than anyone has any business being able to keep track of. And yet, each of these parts meshes flawlessly with all the others. The book ends with such triumphant perfection that it lingers long after you put it down. I can't wait to read this one again.

From the very start, it's clear that some of them <em>can't</em> survive to the end, and Link is merciless in making you root for all of them, even though this means rooting <em>against</em> them all. This, in turn, creates moments of toe-curling, sublime horror.</p>
<p>Link has built a complex machine with more moving parts than anyone has any business being able to keep track of. And yet, each of these parts meshes flawlessly with all the others. The book ends with such triumphant perfection that it lingers long after you put it down. I can't wait to read this one again.</p>

This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Big Tech disrupted disruption (permalink) Before "disruption" turned into a punchline, it was a genuinely exciting idea. Using technology, we could connect people to one another and allow them to collaborate, share, and cooperate to make great things happen. It's easy (and valid) to dismiss the "disruption" of Uber, which "disrupted" taxis and transit by losing $31b worth of Saudi royal money in a bid to collapse the world's rival transportation system, while quietly promising its investors that it would someday have pricing power as a monopoly, and would attain profit through price-gouging and wage-theft. Uber's disruption story was wreathed in bullshit: lies about the "independence" of its drivers, about the imminence of self-driving taxis, about the impact that replacing buses and subways with millions of circling, empty cars would have on traffic congestion. There were and are plenty of problems with traditional taxis and transit, but Uber magnified these problems, under cover of "disrupting" them away. But there are other feats of high-tech disruption that were and are genuinely transformative &#8211; Wikipedia, GNU/Linux, RSS, and more. These disruptive technologies altered the balance of power between powerful institutions and the businesses, communities and individuals they dominated, in ways that have proven both beneficial and durable. When we speak of commercial disruption today, we usually mean a tech company disrupting a non-tech company. Tinder disrupts singles bars. Netflix disrupts Blockbuster. Airbnb disrupts Marriott. But the history of "disruption" features far more examples of tech companies disrupting other tech companies: DEC disrupts IBM. Netscape disrupts Microsoft. Google disrupts Yahoo. Nokia disrupts Kodak, sure &#8211; but then Apple disrupts Nokia. It's only natural that the businesses most vulnerable to digital disruption are other digital businesses. And yet&#8230;disruption is nowhere to be seen when it comes to the tech sector itself. Five giant companies have been running the show for more than a decade. A couple of these companies (Apple, Microsoft) are Gen-Xers, having been born in the 70s, then there's a couple of Millennials (Amazon, Google), and that one Gen-Z kid (Facebook). Big Tech shows no sign of being disrupted, despite the continuous enshittification of their core products and services. How can this be? Has Big Tech disrupted disruption itself? That's the contention of "Coopting Disruption," a new paper from two law profs: Mark Lemley (Stanford) and Matthew Wansley (Yeshiva U): https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4713845 The paper opens with a review of the literature on disruption. Big companies have some major advantages: they've got people and infrastructure they can leverage to bring new products to market more cheaply than startups. They've got existing relationships with suppliers, distributors and customers. People trust them. Diversified, monopolistic companies are also able to capture "involuntary spillovers": when Google spends money on AI for image recognition, it can improve Google Photos, YouTube, Android, Search, Maps and many other products. A startup with just one product can't capitalize on these spillovers in the same way, so it doesn't have the same incentives to spend big on R&#38;D. Finally, big companies have access to cheap money. They get better credit terms from lenders, they can float bonds, they can tap the public markets, or just spend their own profits on R&#38;D. They can also afford to take a long view, because they're not tied to VCs whose funds turn over every 5-10 years. Big companies get cheap money, play a long game, pay less to innovate and get more out of innovation. But those advantages are swamped by the disadvantages of incumbency, all the various curses of bigness. Take Arrow's "replacement effect": new companies that compete with incumbents drive down the incumbents' prices and tempt their customers away. But an incumbent that buys a disruptive new company can just shut it down, and whittle down its ideas to "sustaining innovation" (small improvements to existing products), killing "disruptive innovation" (major changes that make the existing products obsolete). Arrow's Replacement Effect also comes into play before a new product even exists. An incumbent that allows a rival to do R&#38;D that would eventually disrupt its product is at risk; but if the incumbent buys this pre-product, R&#38;D-heavy startup, it can turn the research to sustaining innovation and defund any disruptive innovation. Arrow asks us to look at the innovation question from the point of view of the company as a whole. Clayton Christensen's "Innovator's Dilemma" looks at the motivations of individual decision-makers in large, successful companies. These individuals don't want to disrupt their own business, because that will render some part of their own company obsolete (perhaps their own division!). They also don't want to radically change their customers' businesses, because those customers would also face negative effects from disruption. A startup, by contrast, has no existing successful divisions and no giant customers to safeguard. They have nothing to lose and everything to gain from disruption. Where a large company has no way for individual employees to initiate major changes in corporate strategy, a startup has fewer hops between employees and management. What's more, a startup can rewards an employee's good idea with a stock-grant ties that employee's future finances to the outcome of that idea &#8211; while a giant corporation's stock bonuses are only incidentally tied to the ideas of any individual worker. Big companies are where good ideas go to die. If a big company passes on its employees' cool, disruptive ideas, that's the end of the story for that idea. But even if 100 VCs pass on a startup's cool idea and only one VC funds it, the startup still gets to pursue that idea. In startup land, a good idea gets lots of chances &#8211; in a big company, it only gets one. Given how innately disruptable tech companies are, given how hard it is for big companies to innovate, and given how little innovation we've gotten from Big Tech, how is it that the tech giants haven't been disrupted? The authors propose a four-step program for the would-be Tech Baron hoping to defend their turf from disruption. First, gather information about startups that might develop disruptive technologies and steer them away from competing with you, by investing in them or partnering with them. Second, cut off any would-be competitor's supply of resources they need to develop a disruptive product that challenges your own. Third, convince the government to pass regulations that big, established companies can comply with but that are business-killing challenges for small competitors. Finally, buy up any company that resists your steering, succeeds despite your resource war, and escapes the compliance moats of regulation that favors incumbents. Then: kill those companies. The authors proceed to show that all four tactics are in play today. Big Tech companies operate their own VC funds, which means they get a look at every promising company in the field, even if they don't want to invest in them. Big Tech companies are also awash in money and their "rival" VCs know it, and so financial VCs and Big Tech collude to fund potential disruptors and then sell them to Big Tech companies as "acqui-hires" that see the disruption neutralized. On resources, the authors focus on data, and how companies like Facebook have explicit policies of only permitting companies they don't see as potential disruptors to access Facebook data. They reproduce internal Facebook strategy memos that divide potential platform users into "existing competitors, possible future competitors, [or] developers that we have alignment with on business models." These categories allow Facebook to decide which companies are capable of developing disruptive products and which ones aren't. For example, Amazon &#8211; which doesn't compete with Facebook &#8211; is allowed to access FB data to target shoppers. But Messageme, a startup, was cut off from Facebook as soon as management perceived them as a future rival. Ironically &#8211; but unsurprisingly &#8211; Facebook spins these policies as pro-privacy, not anti-competitive. These data policies cast a long shadow. They don't just block existing companies from accessing the data they need to pursue disruptive offerings &#8211; they also "send a message" to would-be founders and investors, letting them know that if they try to disrupt a tech giant, they will have their market oxygen cut off before they can draw breath. The only way to build a product that challenges Facebook is as Facebook's partner, under Facebook's direction, with Facebook's veto. Next, regulation. Starting in 2019, Facebook started publishing full-page newspaper ads calling for regulation. Someone ghost-wrote a Washington Post op-ed under Zuckerberg's byline, arguing the case for more tech regulation. Google, Apple, OpenAI other tech giants have all (selectively) lobbied in favor of many regulations. These rules covered a lot of ground, but they all share a characteristic: complying with them requires huge amounts of money &#8211; money that giant tech companies can spare, but potential disruptors lack. Finally, there's predatory acquisitions. Mark Zuckerberg, working without the benefit of a ghost writer (or in-house counsel to review his statements for actionable intent) has repeatedly confessed to buying companies like Instagram to ensure that they never grow to be competitors. As he told one colleague, "I remember your internal post about how Instagram was our threat and not Google+. You were basically right. The thing about startups though is you can often acquire them.” All the tech giants are acquisition factories. Every successful Google product, almost without exception, is a product they bought from someone else. By contrast, Google's own internal products typically crash and burn, from G+ to Reader to Google Videos. Apple, meanwhile, buys 90 companies per year &#8211; Tim Apple brings home a new company for his shareholders more often than you bring home a bag of groceries for your family. All the Big Tech companies' AI offerings are acquisitions, and Apple has bought more AI companies than any of them. Big Tech claims to be innovating, but it's really just operationalizing. Any company that threatens to disrupt a tech giant is bought, its products stripped of any really innovative features, and the residue is added to existing products as a "sustaining innovation" &#8211; a dot-release feature that has all the innovative disruption of rounding the corners on a new mobile phone. The authors present three case-studies of tech companies using this four-point strategy to forestall disruption in AI, VR and self-driving cars. I'm not excited about any of these three categories, but it's clear that the tech giants are worried about them, and the authors make a devastating case for these disruptions being disrupted by Big Tech. What do to about it? If we like (some) disruption, and if Big Tech is enshittifying at speed without facing dethroning-by-disruption, how do we get the dynamism and innovation that gave us the best of tech? The authors make four suggestions. First, revive the authorities under existing antitrust law to ban executives from Big Tech companies from serving on the boards of startups. More broadly, kill interlocking boards altogether. Remember, these powers already exist in the lawbooks, so accomplishing this goal means a change in enforcement priorities, not a new act of Congress or rulemaking. What's more, interlocking boards between competing companies are illegal per se, meaning there's no expensive, difficult fact-finding needed to demonstrate that two companies are breaking the law by sharing directors. Next: create a nondiscrimination policy that requires the largest tech companies that share data with some unaffiliated companies to offer data on the same terms to other companies, except when they are direct competitors. They argue that this rule will keep tech giants from choking off disruptive technologies that make them obsolete (rather than competing with them). On the subject of regulation and compliance moats, they have less concrete advice. They counsel lawmakers to greet tech giants' demands to be regulated with suspicion, to proceed with caution when they do regulate, and to shape regulation so that it doesn't limit market entry, by keeping in mind the disproportionate burdens regulations put on established giants and small new companies. This is all good advice, but it's more a set of principles than any kind of specific practice, test or procedure. Finally, they call for increased scrutiny of mergers, including mergers between very large companies and small startups. They argue that existing law (Sec 2 of the Sherman Act and Sec 7 of the Clayton Act) empowers enforcers to block these acquisitions. They admit that the case-law on this is poor, but that just means that enforcers need to start making new case-law. I like all of these suggestions! We're certainly enjoying a more activist set of regulators, who are more interested in Big Tech, than we've seen in generations. But they are grossly under-resourced even without giving them additional duties. As Matt Stoller points out, "the DOJ's Antitrust Division has fewer people enforcing anti-monopoly laws in a $24 trillion economy than the Smithsonian Museum has security guards." https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/congressional-republicans-to-defund What's more, Republicans are trying to slash their budgets even further. The American conservative movement has finally located a police force they're eager to defund: the corporate police who defend us all from predatory monopolies.

<h1>Big Tech disrupted disruption (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/08/permanent-overlords/#republicans-want-to-defund-the-police">permalink</a>)</h1>
<p>Before "disruption" turned into a punchline, it was a genuinely exciting idea. Using technology, we could connect people to one another and allow them to collaborate, share, and cooperate to make great things happen.</p>
<p>It's easy (and valid) to dismiss the "disruption" of Uber, which "disrupted" taxis and transit by losing $31b worth of Saudi royal money in a bid to collapse the world's rival transportation system, while quietly promising its investors that it would someday have pricing power as a monopoly, and would attain profit through price-gouging and wage-theft.</p>
<p>Uber's disruption story was wreathed in bullshit: lies about the "independence" of its drivers, about the imminence of self-driving taxis, about the impact that replacing buses and subways with millions of circling, empty cars would have on traffic congestion. There were and are plenty of problems with traditional taxis and transit, but Uber <em>magnified</em> these problems, under cover of "disrupting" them away.</p>
<p>But there are other feats of high-tech disruption that were and are genuinely transformative &#8211; Wikipedia, GNU/Linux, RSS, and more. These disruptive technologies altered the balance of power between powerful institutions and the businesses, communities and individuals they dominated, in ways that have proven both beneficial and durable.</p>
<p>When we speak of commercial disruption today, we usually mean a tech company disrupting a non-tech company. Tinder disrupts singles bars. Netflix disrupts Blockbuster. Airbnb disrupts Marriott.</p>
<p>But the history of "disruption" features far more examples of tech companies disrupting <em>other tech companies</em>: DEC disrupts IBM. Netscape disrupts Microsoft. Google disrupts Yahoo. Nokia disrupts Kodak, sure &#8211; but then Apple disrupts Nokia. It's only natural that the businesses most vulnerable to digital disruption are <em>other</em> digital businesses.</p>
<p>And yet&#8230;disruption is nowhere to be seen when it comes to the tech sector itself. Five giant companies have been running the show for more than a decade. A couple of these companies (Apple, Microsoft) are Gen-Xers, having been born in the 70s, then there's a couple of Millennials (Amazon, Google), and that one Gen-Z kid (Facebook). Big Tech shows no sign of being disrupted, despite the continuous enshittification of their core products and services. How can this be? Has Big Tech disrupted disruption itself?</p>
<p>That's the contention of "Coopting Disruption," a new paper from two law profs: Mark Lemley (Stanford) and Matthew Wansley (Yeshiva U):</p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4713845">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4713845</a></p>
<p>The paper opens with a review of the literature on disruption. Big companies have some major advantages: they've got people and infrastructure they can leverage to bring new products to market more cheaply than startups. They've got existing relationships with suppliers, distributors and customers. People trust them.</p>
<p>Diversified, monopolistic companies are also able to capture "involuntary spillovers": when Google spends money on AI for image recognition, it can improve Google Photos, YouTube, Android, Search, Maps and many other products. A startup with just one product can't capitalize on these spillovers in the same way, so it doesn't have the same incentives to spend big on R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Finally, big companies have access to cheap money. They get better credit terms from lenders, they can float bonds, they can tap the public markets, or just spend their own profits on R&amp;D. They can also afford to take a long view, because they're not tied to VCs whose funds turn over every 5-10 years. Big companies get cheap money, play a long game, pay less to innovate and get more out of innovation.</p>
<p>But those advantages are swamped by the <em>disadvantages</em> of incumbency, all the various curses of bigness. Take Arrow's "replacement effect": new companies that compete with incumbents drive down the incumbents' prices and tempt their customers away. But an incumbent that <em>buys</em> a disruptive new company can just shut it down, and whittle down its ideas to "sustaining innovation" (small improvements to existing products), killing "disruptive innovation" (major changes that make the existing products obsolete).</p>
<p>Arrow's Replacement Effect also comes into play <em>before</em> a new product even exists. An incumbent that allows a rival to do R&amp;D that would eventually disrupt its product is at risk; but if the incumbent buys this pre-product, R&amp;D-heavy startup, it can turn the research to sustaining innovation and defund any disruptive innovation.</p>
<p>Arrow asks us to look at the innovation question from the point of view of the company as a whole. Clayton Christensen's "Innovator's Dilemma" looks at the motivations of individual decision-makers in large, successful companies. These individuals don't want to disrupt their own business, because that will render some part of their own company obsolete (perhaps their own division!). They also don't want to radically change their customers' businesses, because those customers would also face negative effects from disruption.</p>

Where a large company has no way for individual employees to initiate major changes in corporate strategy, a startup has fewer hops between employees and management. What's more, a startup can rewards an employee's good idea with a stock-grant ties that employee's future finances to the outcome of that idea &#8211; while a giant corporation's stock bonuses are only incidentally tied to the ideas of any individual worker.</p>
<p>Big companies are where good ideas go to die. If a big company passes on its employees' cool, disruptive ideas, that's the end of the story for that idea. But even if 100 VCs pass on a startup's cool idea and only one VC funds it, the startup still gets to pursue that idea.

Big Tech companies are also awash in money and their "rival" VCs know it, and so financial VCs and Big Tech collude to fund potential disruptors and then sell them to Big Tech companies as "acqui-hires" that see the disruption neutralized.</p>
<p>On resources, the authors focus on data, and how companies like Facebook have explicit policies of only permitting companies they don't see as potential disruptors to access Facebook data. They reproduce internal Facebook strategy memos that divide potential platform users into "existing competitors, possible future competitors, [or] developers that we have alignment with on business models." These categories allow Facebook to decide which companies are capable of developing disruptive products and which ones aren't. For example, Amazon &#8211; which doesn't compete with Facebook &#8211; is allowed to access FB data to target shoppers. But Messageme, a startup, was cut off from Facebook as soon as management perceived them as a future rival. Ironically &#8211; but unsurprisingly &#8211; Facebook spins these policies as pro-privacy, not anti-competitive.</p>
<p>These data policies cast a long shadow. They don't just block existing companies from accessing the data they need to pursue disruptive offerings &#8211; they also "send a message" to would-be founders and investors, letting them know that if they try to disrupt a tech giant, they will have their market oxygen cut off before they can draw breath. The only way to build a product that challenges Facebook is as Facebook's partner, under Facebook's direction, with Facebook's veto.</p>
<p>Next, regulation. Starting in 2019, Facebook started publishing full-page newspaper ads calling for regulation. Someone ghost-wrote a <em>Washington Post</em> op-ed under Zuckerberg's byline, arguing the case for more tech regulation. Google, Apple, OpenAI other tech giants have all (selectively) lobbied in favor of many regulations. These rules covered a lot of ground, but they all share a characteristic: complying with them requires huge amounts of money &#8211; money that giant tech companies can spare, but potential disruptors lack.</p>
<p>Finally, there's predatory acquisitions. Mark Zuckerberg, working without the benefit of a ghost writer (or in-house counsel to review his statements for actionable intent) has repeatedly confessed to buying companies like Instagram to ensure that they never grow to be competitors. As he told one colleague, "I remember your internal post about how Instagram was our threat and not Google+. You were basically right. The thing about startups though is you can often acquire them.”</p>
<p>All the tech giants are acquisition factories. Every successful Google product, almost without exception, is a product they bought from someone else. By contrast, Google's own internal products typically crash and burn, from G+ to Reader to Google Videos. Apple, meanwhile, buys 90 companies per year &#8211; Tim Apple brings home a new company for his shareholders more often than you bring home a bag of groceries for your family. All the Big Tech companies' AI offerings are acquisitions, and Apple has bought more AI companies than any of them.</p>
<p>Big Tech claims to be innovating, but it's really just operationalizing. Any company that threatens to disrupt a tech giant is bought, its products stripped of any really innovative features, and the residue is added to existing products as a "sustaining innovation" &#8211; a dot-release feature that has all the innovative disruption of rounding the corners on a new mobile phone.</p>
<p>The authors present three case-studies of tech companies using this four-point strategy to forestall disruption in AI, VR and self-driving cars. I'm not excited about any of these three categories, but it's clear that the tech giants <em>are</em> worried about them, and the authors make a devastating case for these disruptions being disrupted by Big Tech.</p>
<p>What do to about it? If we like (some) disruption, and if Big Tech is enshittifying at speed without facing dethroning-by-disruption, how do we get the dynamism and innovation that gave us the best of tech?</p>
<p>The authors make four suggestions.</p>
<p>First, revive the authorities under existing antitrust law to ban executives from Big Tech companies from serving on the boards of startups. More broadly, kill interlocking boards altogether. Remember, these powers already exist in the lawbooks, so accomplishing this goal means a change in enforcement priorities, not a new act of Congress or rulemaking. What's more, interlocking boards between competing companies are illegal <em>per se</em>, meaning there's no expensive, difficult fact-finding needed to demonstrate that two companies are breaking the law by sharing directors.</p>
<p>Next: create a nondiscrimination policy that requires the largest tech companies that share data with some unaffiliated companies to offer data on the same terms to other companies, except when they are direct competitors. They argue that this rule will keep tech giants from choking off disruptive technologies that make them obsolete (rather than competing with them).</p>
<p>On the subject of regulation and compliance moats, they have less concrete advice. They counsel lawmakers to greet tech giants' demands to be regulated with suspicion, to proceed with caution when they do regulate, and to shape regulation so that it doesn't limit market entry, by keeping in mind the disproportionate burdens regulations put on established giants and small new companies. This is all good advice, but it's more a set of principles than any kind of specific practice, test or procedure.</p>
<p>Finally, they call for increased scrutiny of mergers, including mergers between very large companies and small startups. They argue that existing law (Sec 2 of the Sherman Act and Sec 7 of the Clayton Act) empowers enforcers to block these acquisitions. They admit that the case-law on this is poor, but that just means that enforcers need to start making new case-law.</p>
<p>I like all of these suggestions! We're certainly enjoying a more activist set of regulators, who are more interested in Big Tech, than we've seen in generations.</p>
<p>But they are grossly under-resourced even without giving them additional duties. As Matt Stoller points out, "the DOJ's Antitrust Division has fewer people enforcing anti-monopoly laws in a $24 trillion economy than the Smithsonian Museum has security guards."</p>

<p>What's more, Republicans are trying to slash their budgets even further. The American conservative movement has finally located a police force they're eager to defund: the corporate police who defend us all from predatory monopolies.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today's links The CHIPS Act treats the symptoms, but not the causes: Monopoly destroyed America's high-tech capacity. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading The CHIPS Act treats the symptoms, but not the causes (permalink) There's this great throwaway line in 1992's Sneakers, where Dan Aykroyd, playing a conspiracy-addled hacker/con-man, is feverishly telling Sydney Poitier (playing an ex-CIA spook) about a 1958 meeting Eisenhower had with aliens where Ike said, "hey, look, give us your technology, and we'll give you all the cow lips you want." Poitier dismisses Aykroyd ("Don't listen to this man. He's certifiable"). We're meant to be on Poitier's side here, but I've always harbored some sympathy for Aykroyd in this scene. That's because I often hear echoes of Aykroyd's theory in my own explanations of the esoteric bargains and plots that produced the world we're living in today. Of course, in my world, it's not presidents bargaining for alien technology in exchange for cow-lips &#8211; it's the world's wealthy nations bargaining to drop trade restrictions on the Global South in exchange for IP laws. These bargains &#8211; which started as a series of bilateral and then multilateral agreements like NAFTA, and culminated in the WTO agreement of 1999 &#8211; were the most important step in the reordering of the world's economy around rent-extraction, cheap labor exploitation, and a brittle supply chain that is increasingly endangered by the polycrisis of climate and its handmaidens, like zoonotic plagues, water wars, and mass refugee migration. Prior to the advent of "free trade," the world's rich countries fashioned debt into a whip-hand over poor, post-colonial nations. These countries had been bankrupted by their previous colonial owners, and the price of their freedom was punishing debts to the IMF and other rich-world institutions in exchange for loans to help these countries "develop." Like all poor debtors, these countries were said to have gotten into their predicament through moral failure &#8211; they'd "lived beyond their means." (When rich people get into debt, bankruptcy steps in to give them space to "restructure" according to their own plans. When poor people get into debt, bankruptcy strips them of nearly everything that might help them recover, brands them with a permanent scarlet letter, and subjects them to humiliating micro-management whose explicit message is that they are not competent to manage their own affairs): https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/07/hr-4193/#shoppers-choice So the poor debtor nations were ordered to "deregulate." They had to sell off their state assets, run their central banks according to the dictates of rich-world finance authorities, and reorient their production around supplying raw materials to rich countries, who would process these materials into finished goods for export back to the poor world. Naturally, poor countries were not allowed to erect "trade barriers" that might erode the capacity of this North-South transfer of high-margin goods, but this was not the era of free trade. It wasn't the free trade era because, while the North-South transfer was largely unrestricted, the South-North transfer was subject to tight regulation in the rich world. In other words, poor countries were expected to export, say, raw ore to the USA and reimport high-tech goods, with low tariffs in both directions. But if a poor country processed that ore domestically and made its own finished goods, the US would block those goods at the border, slapping them with high tariffs that made them more expensive than Made-in-the-USA equivalents. The argument for this unidirectional trade was that the US &#8211; and other rich countries &#8211; had a strategic need to maintain their manufacturing industries as a hedge against future geopolitical events (war, but also pandemics, extreme weather) that might leave the rich world unable to provide for itself. This rationale had a key advantage: it was true. A country that manages its own central bank can create as much of its own currency as it wants, and use that money to buy anything for sale in its own currency. This may not be crucial while global markets are operating to the country's advantage (say, while the rest of the world is "willingly" pricing its raw materials in your country's currency), but when things go wrong &#8211; war, plague, weather &#8211; a country that can't make things is at the rest of the world's mercy. If you had to choose between being a poor post-colonial nation that couldn't supply its own technological needs except by exporting raw materials to rich countries, and being a rich country that had both domestic manufacturing capacity and a steady supply of other countries' raw materials, you would choose the second, every time. What's not to like? Here's what. The problem &#8211; from the perspective of America's ultra-wealthy &#8211; was that this arrangement gave the US workforce a lot of power. As US workers unionized, they were able to extract direct concessions from their employers through collective bargaining, and they could effectively lobby for universal worker protections, including a robust welfare state &#8211; in both state and federal legislatures. The US was better off as a whole, but the richest ten percent were much poorer than they could be if only they could smash worker power. That's where free trade comes in. Notwithstanding racist nonsense about "primitive" countries, there's no intrinsic defect that stops the global south from doing high-tech manufacturing. If the rich world's corporate leaders were given free rein to sideline America's national security in favor of their own profits, they could certainly engineer the circumstances whereby poor countries would build sophisticated factories to replace the manufacturing facilities that sit behind the north's high tariff walls. These poor-country factories could produce goods every bit as valuable as the rich world's shops, but without the labor, environmental and financial regulations that constrain their owners' profits. Companies slavered for a business environment that let them kill workers; poison the air, land and water; and cheat the tax authorities with impunity. For this plan to work, the wealthy needed to engineer changes in both the rich world and the poor world. Obviously, they would have to get rid of the rich world's tariff walls, which made it impossible to competitively import goods made in the global south, no matter how cheaply they were made. But free trade wasn't just about deregulation in the north &#8211; it also required a whole slew of new, extremely onerous regulations in the global south. Corporations that relocated their manufacturing to poor &#8211; but nominally sovereign &#8211; countries needed to be sure that those countries wouldn't try to replicate the American plan of becoming actually sovereign, by exerting control over the means of production within their borders. Recall that the American Revolution was inspired in large part by fury over the requirement to ship raw materials back to Mother England and then buy them back at huge markups after they'd been processed by English workers, to the enrichment of English aristocrats. Post-colonial America created new regulations (tariffs on goods from England), and &#8211; crucially &#8211; they also deregulated. Specifically, post-revolutionary America abolished copyrights and patents for English persons and firms. That way, American manufacturers could produce sophisticated finished goods without paying rent to England's wealthy making those goods cheaper for American buyers, and American publishers could subsidize their editions of American authors' books by publishing English authors on the cheap, without the obligation to share profits with English publishers or English writers. The surplus produced by ignoring the patents and copyrights of the English was divided (unequally) among American capitalists, workers, and shoppers. Wealthy Americans got richer, even as they paid their workers more and charged less for their products. This incubated a made-in-the-USA edition of the industrial revolution. It was so successful that the rest of the world &#8211; especially England &#8211; began importing American goods and literature, and then American publishers and manufacturers started to lean on their government to "respect" English claims, in order to secure bilateral protections for their inventions and books in English markets. This was good for America, but it was terrible for English manufacturers. The US &#8211; a primitive, agricultural society &#8211; "stole" their inventions until they gained so much manufacturing capacity that the English public started to prefer American goods to English ones. This was the thing that rich-world industrialists feared about free trade. Once you build your high-tech factories in the global south, what's to stop those people from simply copying your plans &#8211; or worse, seizing your factories! &#8211; and competing with you on a global scale? Some of these countries had nominally socialist governments that claimed to explicitly elevate the public good over the interests of the wealthy. And all of these countries had the same sprinkling of sociopaths who'd gladly see a million children maimed or the land poisoned for a buck &#8211; and these "entrepreneurs" had unbeatable advantages with their countries' political classes. For globalization to work, it wasn't enough to deregulate the rich world &#8211; capitalists also had to regulate the poor world. Specifically, they had to get the poor world to adopt "IP" laws that would force them to willingly pay rent on things they could get for free: patents and other IP, even though it was in the short-term, medium-term, and long-term interests of both the nation and its politicians and its businesspeople. Thus, the bargain that makes me sympathetic to Dan Aykroyd: not cow lips for alien tech; but free trade for IP law. When the WTO was steaming towards passage in the late 1990s, there was (rightly) a lot of emphasis on its deregulatory provisions: weakening of labor, environmental and financial laws in the poor world, and of tariffs in the rich world. But in hindsight, we all kind of missed the main event: the TRIPS (Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights). This actually started before the WTO treaty (it was part of the GATT, a predecessor to the WTO), but the WTO spread it to countries all over the world. Under the TRIPS, poor countries are required to honor the IP claims of rich countries, on pain of global sanction. That was the plan: instead of paying American workers to make Apple computers, say, Apple could export the "IP" for Macs and iPhones to countries like China, and these countries would produce Apple products that were "designed in California, assembled in China." China would allow Apple to treat Chinese workers so badly that they routinely committed suicide, and would lock up or kill workers who tried to unionize. China would accept vast shipments of immortal, toxic e-waste. And China wouldn't let its entrepreneurs copy Apple's designs, be they software, schematics or trademarks. Apple isn't the only company that pursued this strategy, but no company has executed it as successfully. It's not for nothing that Steve Jobs's hand-picked successor was Tim Cook, who oversaw the transfer of even the most exacting elements of Apple manufacturing to Chinese facilities, striking bargains with contractors like Foxconn that guaranteed that workers would be heavily &#8211; lethally! &#8211; surveilled and controlled to prevent the twin horrors of unionization and leaks. For the first two decades of the WTO era, the most obvious problems with this arrangement was wage erosion (for American workers) and leakage (for the rich). China's "socialist" government was only too happy to help Foxconn imprison workers who demanded better wages and working conditions, but they were far more relaxed about knockoffs, be they fake iPods sold in market stalls or US trade secrets working their way into Huawei products. These were problems for the American aristocracy, whose investments depended on China disciplining both Chinese workers and Chinese businesses. For the American people, leakage was a nothingburger. Apple's profits weren't shared with its workforce beyond the relatively small number of tech workers at its headquarters. The vast majority of Apple employees, who flogged iPhones and scrubbed the tilework in gleaming white stores across the nation, would get the same minimal (or even minimum) wage no matter how profitable Apple grew. It wasn't until the pandemic that the other shoe dropped for the American public. The WTO arrangement &#8211; cow lips for alien technology &#8211; had produced a global system of brittle supply chains composed entirely of weakest links. A pandemic, a war, a ship stuck in the Suez Canal or Houthi paramilitaries can cripple the entire system, perhaps indefinitely. For two decades, we fought over globalization's effect on wages. We let our corporate masters trick us into thinking that China's "cheating" on IP was a problem for the average person. But the implications of globalization for American sovereignty and security were banished to the xenophobic right fringe, where they were mixed into the froth of Cold War 2.0 nonsense. The pandemic changed that, creating a coalition that is motivated by a complex and contradictory stew of racism, environmentalism, xenophobia, labor advocacy, patriotism, pragmatism, fear and hope. Out of that stew emerged a new American political tendency, mostly associated with Bidenomics, but also claimed in various guises by the American right, through its America First wing. That tendency's most visible artifact is the CHIPS Act, through which the US government proposes to use policy and subsidies to bring high-tech manufacturing back to America's shores. This week, the American Economic Liberties Project published "Reshoring and Restoring: CHIPS Implementation for a Competitive Semiconductor Industry," a fascinating, beautifully researched and detailed analysis of the CHIPS Act and the global high-tech manufacturing market, written by Todd Achilles, Erik Peinert and Daniel Rangel: https://www.economicliberties.us/our-work/reshoring-and-restoring-chips-implementation-for-a-competitive-semiconductor-industry/# Crucially, the report lays out the role that the weakening of antitrust, the dismantling of tariffs and the strengthening of IP played in the history of the current moment. The failure to enforce antitrust law allowed for monopolization at every stage of the semiconductor industry's supply-chain. The strengthening of IP and the weakening of tariffs encouraged the resulting monopolies to chase cheap labor overseas, confident that the US government would punish host countries that allowed their domestic entrepreneurs to use American designs without permission. The result is a financialized, "capital light" semiconductor industry that has put all its eggs in one basket. For the most advanced chips ("leading-edge logic"), production works like this: American firms design a chip and send the design to Taiwan where a TSMC foundry turns it into a chip. The chip is then shipped to one of a small number of companies in the poor world where they are assembled, packaged and tested (AMP) and sent to China to be integrated into a product. Obsolete foundries get a second life in the commodity chip ("mature-node chips") market &#8211; these are the cheap chips that are shoveled into our cars and appliances and industrial systems. Both of these systems are fundamentally broken. The advanced, "leading-edge" chips rely on geopolitically uncertain, heavily concentrated foundries. These foundries can be fully captured by their customers &#8211; as when Apple prepurchases the entire production capacity of the most advanced chips, denying both domestic and offshore competitors access to the newest computation. Meanwhile, the less powerful, "mature node" chips command minuscule margins, and are often dumped into the market below cost, thanks to subsidies from countries hoping to protect their corner of the high-tech sector. This makes investment in low-power chips uncertain, leading to wild swings in cost, quality and availability of these workhorse chips. The leading-edge chipmakers &#8211; Nvidia, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD, etc &#8211; have fully captured their markets. They like the status quo, and the CHIPS Act won't convince them to invest in onshore production. Why would they? 2022 was Broadcom's best year ever, not in spite of its supply-chain problems, but because of them. Those problems let Broadcom raise prices for a captive audience of customers, who the company strong-armed into exclusivity deals that ensured they had nowhere to turn. Qualcomm also profited handsomely from shortages, because its customers end up paying Qualcomm no matter where they buy, thanks to Qualcomm ensuring that its patents are integrated into global 4G and 5G standards. That means that all standards-conforming products generate royalties for Qualcomm, and it also means that Qualcomm can decide which companies are allowed to compete with it, and which ones will be denied licenses to its patents. Both companies are under orders from the FTC to cut this out, and both companies ignore the FTC. The brittleness of mature-node and leading-edge chips is not inevitable. Advanced memory chips (DRAM) are roughly comparable in complexity to leading-edge chips, while analog-to-digital chips are as easily commodified as mature-node chips, and yet each has a robust and competitive supply chain, with both onshore and offshore producers. In contrast with leading-edge manufacturers (who have been visibly indifferent to the CHIPS incentives), memory chip manufacturers responded to the CHIPS Act by committing hundreds of billions of dollars to new on-shore production facilities. Intel is a curious case: in a world of fabless leading-edge manufacturers, Intel stands out for making its own chips. But Intel is in a lot of trouble. Its advanced manufacturing plans keep foundering on cost overruns and delays. The company keeps losing money. But until recently, its management kept handing its shareholders billions in dividends and buybacks &#8211; a sign that Intel bosses assume that the US public will bail out its "national champion." It's not clear whether the CHIPS Act can save Intel, or whether financialization will continue to hollow out a once-dominant pioneer. The CHIPS Act won't undo the concentration &#8211; and financialization &#8211; of the semiconductor industry. The industry has been awash in cheap money since the 2008 bailouts, and in just the past five years, US semiconductor monopolists have paid out $239b to shareholders in buybacks and dividends, enough to fund the CHIPS Act five times over. If you include Apple in that figure, the amount US corporations spent on shareholder returns instead of investing in capacity rises to $698b. Apple doesn't want a competitive market for chips. If Apple builds its own foundry, that just frees up capacity at TSMC that its competitors can use to improve their products. The report has an enormous amount of accessible, well-organized detail on these markets, and it makes a set of key recommendations for improving the CHIPS Act and passing related legislation to ensure that the US can once again make its own microchips. These run the gamut from funding four new onshore foundries to requiring companies receiving CHIPS Act money to "dual-source" their foundries. They call for NIST and the CPO to ensure open licensing of key patents, and for aggressive policing of anti-dumping rules for cheap chips. They also seek a new law creating an "American Semiconductor Supply Chain Resiliency Fee" &#8211; a tariff on chips made offshore. Fundamentally, these recommendations seek to end the outsourcing made possible by restrictive IP regimes, to undercut Wall Street's power to demand savings from offshoring, and to smash the market power of companies like Apple that make the brittleness of chip manufacturing into a feature, rather than a bug. This would include a return to previous antitrust rules, which limited companies' ability to leverage patents into standards, and to previous IP rules, which limited exclusive rights to chip topography and design ("mask rights"). All of this is likely to lead to the removal the constraints that stop poor countries from doing to America the same things that postcolonial America did to England &#8211; that is, it will usher in an era in which lots of countries make their own chips and other high-tech goods without paying rent to American companies. This is good! It's good for poor countries, who will have more autonomy to control their own technical destiny. It's also good for the world, creating resiliency in the high-tech manufacturing sector that we'll need as the polycrisis overwhelms various places with fire and flood and disease and war. Electrifying, solarizing and adapting the world for climate resilience is fundamentally incompatible with a brittle, highly concentrated tech sector. Pluralizing high-tech production will make America less vulnerable to the gamesmanship of other countries &#8211; and it will also make the rest of the world less vulnerable to American bullying. As Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman describe so beautifully in their 2023 book Underground Empire, the American political establishment is keenly aware of how its chokepoints over global finance and manufacturing can be leveraged to advantage the US at the rest of the world's expense: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/10/weaponized-interdependence/#the-other-swifties Look, I know that Eisenhower didn't trade cow-lips for alien technology &#8211; but our political and commercial elites really did trade national resiliency away for IP laws, and it's a bargain that screwed everyone, except the one percenters whose power and wealth have metastasized into a deadly cancer that threatens the country and the planet.

<h1>The CHIPS Act treats the symptoms, but not the causes (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/07/farewell-mr-chips/#we-used-to-make-things">permalink</a>)</h1>
<p>There's this great throwaway line in 1992's <em>Sneakers</em>, where Dan Aykroyd, playing a conspiracy-addled hacker/con-man, is feverishly telling Sydney Poitier (playing an ex-CIA spook) about a 1958 meeting Eisenhower had with aliens where Ike said, "hey, look, give us your technology, and we'll give you all the cow lips you want."</p>
<p>Poitier dismisses Aykroyd ("Don't listen to this man. He's certifiable"). We're meant to be on Poitier's side here, but I've always harbored some sympathy for Aykroyd  in this scene.</p>
<p>That's because I often hear echoes of Aykroyd's theory in my own explanations of the esoteric bargains and plots that produced the world we're living in today. Of course, in my world, it's not presidents bargaining for alien technology in exchange for cow-lips &#8211; it's the world's wealthy nations bargaining to drop trade restrictions on the Global South in exchange for IP laws.</p>
<p>These bargains &#8211; which started as a series of bilateral and then multilateral agreements like NAFTA, and culminated in the WTO agreement of 1999 &#8211; were the most important step in the reordering of the world's economy around rent-extraction, cheap labor exploitation, and a brittle supply chain that is increasingly endangered by the polycrisis of climate and its handmaidens, like zoonotic plagues, water wars, and mass refugee migration.</p>
<p>Prior to the advent of "free trade," the world's rich countries fashioned debt into a whip-hand over poor, post-colonial nations. These countries had been bankrupted by their previous colonial owners, and the price of their freedom was punishing debts to the IMF and other rich-world institutions in exchange for loans to help these countries "develop."</p>
<p>Like all poor debtors, these countries were said to have gotten into their predicament through moral failure &#8211; they'd "lived beyond their means."</p>
<p>(When rich people get into debt, bankruptcy steps in to give them space to "restructure" according to their own plans. When poor people get into debt, bankruptcy strips them of nearly everything that might help them recover, brands them with a permanent scarlet letter, and subjects them to humiliating micro-management whose explicit message is that they are not competent to manage their own affairs):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/07/hr-4193/#shoppers-choice">https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/07/hr-4193/#shoppers-choice</a></p>
<p>So the poor debtor nations were ordered to "deregulate." They had to sell off their state assets, run their central banks according to the dictates of rich-world finance authorities, and reorient their production around supplying raw materials to rich countries, who would process these materials into finished goods for export back to the poor world.</p>
<p>Naturally, poor countries were not allowed to erect "trade barriers" that might erode the capacity of this North-South transfer of high-margin goods, but this was <em>not</em> the era of free trade. It wasn't the free trade era because, while the North-South transfer was largely unrestricted, the South-North transfer was subject to tight regulation in the rich world.</p>
<p>In other words, poor countries were expected to export, say, raw ore to the USA and reimport high-tech goods, with low tariffs in both directions. But if a poor country processed that ore domestically and made its own finished goods, the US would block those goods at the border, slapping them with high tariffs that made them more expensive than Made-in-the-USA equivalents.</p>
<p>The argument for this unidirectional trade was that the US &#8211; and other rich countries &#8211; had a strategic need to maintain their manufacturing industries as a hedge against future geopolitical events (war, but also pandemics, extreme weather) that might leave the rich world unable to provide for itself. This rationale had a key advantage: it was <em>true</em>.</p>
<p>A country that manages its own central bank can create as much of its own currency as it wants, and use that money to buy anything for sale in its own currency.</p>
<p>This may not be crucial while global markets are operating to the country's advantage (say, while the rest of the world is "willingly" pricing its raw materials in your country's currency), but when things go wrong &#8211; war, plague, weather &#8211; a country that can't make things is at the rest of the world's mercy.</p>
<p>If you had to choose between being a poor post-colonial nation that couldn't supply its own technological needs except by exporting raw materials to rich countries, and being a rich country that had both domestic manufacturing capacity and a steady supply of other countries' raw materials, you would choose the second, every time.</p>
<p>What's not to like?</p>
<p>Here's what.</p>
<p>The problem &#8211; from the perspective of America's ultra-wealthy &#8211; was that this arrangement gave the US workforce a <em>lot</em> of power. As US workers unionized, they were able to extract direct concessions from their employers through collective bargaining, and they could effectively lobby for universal worker protections, including a robust welfare state &#8211; in both state and federal legislatures. The <em>US</em> was better off as a whole, but the richest ten percent were much poorer than they could be if only they could smash worker power.</p>
<p>That's where free trade comes in. Notwithstanding racist nonsense about "primitive" countries, there's no intrinsic defect that stops the global south from doing high-tech manufacturing. If the rich world's corporate leaders were given free rein to sideline America's national security in favor of their own profits, they could certainly engineer the circumstances whereby poor countries would build sophisticated factories to replace the manufacturing facilities that sit behind the north's high tariff walls.</p>
<p>These poor-country factories could produce goods every bit as valuable as the rich world's shops, but without the labor, environmental and financial regulations that constrain their owners' profits. Companies slavered for a business environment that let them kill workers; poison the air, land and water; and cheat the tax authorities with impunity.</p>
<p>For this plan to work, the wealthy needed to engineer changes in both the rich world and the poor world. Obviously, they would have to get rid of the rich world's tariff walls, which made it impossible to competitively import goods made in the global south, no matter how cheaply they were made.</p>
<p>But free trade wasn't <em>just</em> about deregulation in the north &#8211; it also required a whole slew of new, extremely onerous regulations in the global south. Corporations that relocated their manufacturing to poor &#8211; but nominally sovereign &#8211; countries needed to be sure that <em>those</em> countries wouldn't try to replicate the American plan of becoming <em>actually</em> sovereign, by exerting control over the means of production within their borders.</p>
<p>Recall that the American Revolution was inspired in large part by fury over the requirement to ship raw materials back to Mother England and then buy them back at huge markups after they'd been processed by English workers, to the enrichment of English aristocrats. Post-colonial America created new regulations (tariffs on goods from England), and &#8211; crucially &#8211; they also <em>deregulated</em>.</p>
<p>Specifically, post-revolutionary America abolished copyrights and patents for English persons and firms. That way, American manufacturers could produce sophisticated finished goods without paying rent to England's wealthy making those goods cheaper for American buyers, and American publishers could subsidize their editions of American authors' books by publishing English authors on the cheap, without the obligation to share profits with English publishers or English writers.</p>
<p>The surplus produced by ignoring the patents and copyrights of the English was divided (unequally) among American capitalists, workers, and shoppers. Wealthy Americans got richer, even as they paid their workers more and charged less for their products. This incubated a made-in-the-USA edition of the industrial revolution. It was so successful that the rest of the world &#8211; especially England &#8211; began importing American goods and literature, and then <em>American</em> publishers and manufacturers started to lean on their government to "respect" English claims, in order to secure bilateral protections for their inventions and books in English markets.</p>
<p>This was good for America, but it was terrible for English manufacturers. The US &#8211; a primitive, agricultural society &#8211; "stole" their inventions until they gained so much manufacturing capacity that the English public started to prefer American goods to English ones.</p>
<p>This was the thing that rich-world industrialists feared about free trade. Once you build your high-tech factories in the global south, what's to stop those people from simply copying your plans &#8211; or worse, seizing your factories! &#8211; and competing with you on a global scale? Some of these countries had nominally socialist governments that claimed to explicitly elevate the public good over the interests of the wealthy. And <em>all</em> of these countries had the same sprinkling of sociopaths who'd gladly see a million children maimed or the land poisoned for a buck &#8211; and these "entrepreneurs" had unbeatable advantages with their countries' political classes.</p>
<p>For globalization to work, it wasn't enough to deregulate the rich world &#8211; capitalists also had to <em>regulate</em> the poor world. Specifically, they had to get the poor world to adopt "IP" laws that would force them to willingly pay rent on things they could get for free: patents and other IP, even though it was in the short-term, medium-term, <em>and</em> long-term interests of <em>both</em> the nation <em>and</em> its politicians <em>and</em> its businesspeople.</p>
<p>Thus, the bargain that makes me sympathetic to Dan Aykroyd: not cow lips for alien tech; but free trade for IP law. When the WTO was steaming towards passage in the late 1990s, there was (rightly) a lot of emphasis on its deregulatory provisions: weakening of labor, environmental and financial laws in the poor world, and of tariffs in the rich world.</p>
<p>But in hindsight, we all kind of missed the main event: the TRIPS (Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights). This actually started before the WTO treaty (it was part of the GATT, a predecessor to the WTO), but the WTO spread it to countries all over the world. Under the TRIPS, poor countries are required to honor the IP claims of rich countries, on pain of global sanction.</p>
<p>That was the plan: instead of paying American workers to make Apple computers, say, Apple could export the "IP" for Macs and iPhones to countries like China, and these countries would produce Apple products that were "designed in California, assembled in China." China would allow Apple to treat Chinese workers so badly that they routinely committed suicide, and would lock up or kill workers who tried to unionize. China would accept vast shipments of immortal, toxic e-waste. And China wouldn't let its entrepreneurs copy Apple's designs, be they software, schematics or trademarks.</p>
<p>Apple isn't the only company that pursued this strategy, but no company has executed it as successfully. It's not for nothing that Steve Jobs's hand-picked successor was Tim Cook, who oversaw the transfer of even the most exacting elements of Apple manufacturing to Chinese facilities, striking bargains with contractors like Foxconn that guaranteed that workers would be heavily &#8211; lethally! &#8211; surveilled and controlled to prevent the twin horrors of unionization and leaks.</p>
<p>For the first two decades of the WTO era, the most obvious problems with this arrangement was wage erosion (for American workers) and <em>leakage</em> (for the rich). China's "socialist" government was only too happy to help Foxconn imprison workers who demanded better wages and working conditions, but they were far more relaxed about knockoffs, be they fake iPods sold in market stalls or US trade secrets working their way into Huawei products.</p>
<p>These were problems for the American aristocracy, whose investments depended on China disciplining <em>both</em> Chinese workers <em>and</em> Chinese businesses. For the American people, leakage was a nothingburger. Apple's profits weren't shared with its workforce beyond the relatively small number of tech workers at its headquarters. The vast majority of Apple employees, who flogged iPhones and scrubbed the tilework in gleaming white stores across the nation, would get the same minimal (or even minimum) wage no matter how profitable Apple grew.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the pandemic that the other shoe dropped for the American public. The WTO arrangement &#8211; cow lips for alien technology &#8211; had produced a global system of brittle supply chains composed entirely of weakest links. A pandemic, a war, a ship stuck in the Suez Canal or Houthi paramilitaries can cripple the entire system, perhaps indefinitely.</p>
<p>For two decades, we fought over globalization's effect on wages. We let our corporate masters trick us into thinking that China's "cheating" on IP was a problem for the average person. But the implications of globalization for American sovereignty and security were banished to the xenophobic right fringe, where they were mixed into the froth of Cold War 2.0 nonsense. The pandemic changed that, creating a coalition that is motivated by a complex and contradictory stew of racism, environmentalism, xenophobia, labor advocacy, patriotism, pragmatism, fear and hope.</p>
<p>Out of that stew emerged a new American political tendency, mostly associated with Bidenomics, but also claimed in various guises by the American right, through its America First wing. That tendency's most visible artifact is the CHIPS Act, through which the US government proposes to use policy and subsidies to bring high-tech manufacturing back to America's shores.</p>
<p>This week, the American Economic Liberties Project published "Reshoring and Restoring: CHIPS Implementation for a Competitive Semiconductor Industry," a fascinating, beautifully researched and detailed analysis of the CHIPS Act and the global high-tech manufacturing market, written by Todd Achilles, Erik Peinert and Daniel Rangel:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.economicliberties.us/our-work/reshoring-and-restoring-chips-implementation-for-a-competitive-semiconductor-industry/#">https://www.economicliberties.us/our-work/reshoring-and-restoring-chips-implementation-for-a-competitive-semiconductor-industry/#</a></p>
<p>Crucially, the report lays out the role that the weakening of antitrust, the dismantling of tariffs and the strengthening of IP played in the history of the current moment. The failure to enforce antitrust law allowed for monopolization at every stage of the semiconductor industry's supply-chain. The strengthening of IP and the weakening of tariffs encouraged the resulting monopolies to chase cheap labor overseas, confident that the US government would punish host countries that allowed their domestic entrepreneurs to use American designs without permission.</p>
<p>The result is a financialized, "capital light" semiconductor industry that has put all its eggs in one basket. For the most advanced chips ("leading-edge logic"), production works like this: American firms design a chip and send the design to Taiwan where a TSMC foundry turns it into a chip. The chip is then shipped to one of a small number of companies in the poor world where they are assembled, packaged and tested (AMP) and sent to China to be integrated into a product.</p>
<p>Obsolete foundries get a second life in the commodity chip ("mature-node chips") market &#8211; these are the cheap chips that are shoveled into our cars and appliances and industrial systems.</p>
<p>Both of these systems are fundamentally broken. The advanced, "leading-edge" chips rely on geopolitically uncertain, heavily concentrated foundries. These foundries can be fully captured by their customers &#8211; as when Apple prepurchases the <em>entire production capacity</em> of the most advanced chips, denying both domestic and offshore competitors access to the newest computation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the less powerful, "mature node" chips command minuscule margins, and are often dumped into the market below cost, thanks to subsidies from countries hoping to protect their corner of the high-tech sector. This makes investment in low-power chips uncertain, leading to wild swings in cost, quality and availability of these workhorse chips.</p>
<p>The leading-edge chipmakers &#8211; Nvidia, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD, etc &#8211; have fully captured their markets. They <em>like</em> the status quo, and the CHIPS Act won't convince them to invest in onshore production. Why would they?</p>
<p>2022 was Broadcom's best year ever, not in spite of its supply-chain problems, but because of them. Those problems let Broadcom raise prices for a captive audience of customers, who the company strong-armed into exclusivity deals that ensured they had nowhere to turn. Qualcomm also profited handsomely from shortages, because its customers end up paying Qualcomm no matter where they buy, thanks to Qualcomm ensuring that its patents are integrated into global 4G and 5G standards.</p>
<p>That means that <em>all</em> standards-conforming products generate royalties for Qualcomm, and it also means that Qualcomm can decide which companies are allowed to compete with it, and which ones will be denied licenses to its patents. Both companies are under orders from the FTC to cut this out, and both companies ignore the FTC.</p>
<p>The brittleness of mature-node and leading-edge chips is <em>not</em> inevitable. Advanced memory chips (DRAM) are roughly comparable in complexity to leading-edge chips, while analog-to-digital chips are as easily commodified as mature-node chips, and yet each has a robust and competitive supply chain, with both onshore and offshore producers. In contrast with leading-edge manufacturers (who have been visibly indifferent to the CHIPS incentives), memory chip manufacturers responded to the CHIPS Act by committing hundreds of billions of dollars to new on-shore production facilities.</p>
<p>Intel is a curious case: in a world of fabless leading-edge manufacturers, Intel stands out for making its own chips. But Intel is in a <em>lot</em> of trouble. Its advanced manufacturing plans keep foundering on cost overruns and delays. The company keeps losing money. But until recently, its management kept handing its shareholders billions in dividends and buybacks &#8211; a sign that Intel bosses assume that the US public will bail out its "national champion." It's not clear whether the CHIPS Act can save Intel, or whether financialization will continue to hollow out a once-dominant pioneer.</p>
<p>The CHIPS Act won't undo the concentration &#8211; and financialization &#8211; of the semiconductor industry. The industry has been awash in cheap money since the 2008 bailouts, and in just the past five years, US semiconductor monopolists have paid out $239b to shareholders in buybacks and dividends, enough to fund the CHIPS Act five times over. If you include Apple in that figure, the amount US corporations spent on shareholder returns instead of investing in capacity rises to <em>$698b</em>. Apple doesn't want a competitive market for chips. If Apple builds its own foundry, that just frees up capacity at TSMC that its competitors can use to improve their products.</p>
<p>The report has an enormous amount of accessible, well-organized detail on these markets, and it makes a set of key recommendations for improving the CHIPS Act and passing related legislation to ensure that the US can once again make its own microchips. These run the gamut from funding four new onshore foundries to requiring companies receiving CHIPS Act money to "dual-source" their foundries. They call for NIST and the CPO to ensure open licensing of key patents, and for aggressive policing of anti-dumping rules for cheap chips. They also seek a new law creating an "American Semiconductor Supply Chain Resiliency Fee" &#8211; a tariff on chips made offshore.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, these recommendations seek to end the outsourcing made possible by restrictive IP regimes, to undercut Wall Street's power to demand savings from offshoring, and to smash the market power of companies like Apple that make the brittleness of chip manufacturing into a feature, rather than a bug. This would include a return to previous antitrust rules, which limited companies' ability to leverage patents into standards, and to previous IP rules, which limited exclusive rights to chip topography and design ("mask rights").</p>
<p>All of this is likely to lead to the removal the constraints that stop poor countries from doing to America the same things that postcolonial America did to England &#8211; that is, it will usher in an era in which lots of countries make their own chips and other high-tech goods without paying rent to American companies. This is good! It's good for poor countries, who will have more autonomy to control their own technical destiny. It's also good for the world, creating resiliency in the high-tech manufacturing sector that we'll need as the polycrisis overwhelms various places with fire and flood and disease and war. Electrifying, solarizing and adapting the world for climate resilience is fundamentally incompatible with a brittle, highly concentrated tech sector.</p>
<p>Pluralizing high-tech production will make America less vulnerable to the gamesmanship of other countries &#8211; and it will also make the rest of the world less vulnerable to American bullying. As Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman describe so beautifully in their 2023 book <em>Underground Empire</em>, the American political establishment is keenly aware of how its chokepoints over global finance and manufacturing can be leveraged to advantage the US at the rest of the world's expense:</p>

<p>Look, I know that Eisenhower didn't trade cow-lips for alien technology &#8211; but our political and commercial elites really <em>did</em> trade national resiliency away for IP laws, and it's a bargain that screwed everyone, except the one percenters whose power and wealth have metastasized into a deadly cancer that threatens the country and the planet.</p>
